Basic Installation
==================

  These are generic installation instructions.

  cmake attempts to guess correct values for various system-dependent
  variables used during compilation.  It uses those values to create 
  a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.  It may also create one
  or more `.h' files containing system-dependent definitions..

  The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `cmake' to configure the package for your system.

     Running `cmake' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.

Options
=======

  enable-fortran : enables fortran support

  enable-aster   : enables aster support

cmake usefull variables
=======================

  CASTEM_INSTALL_PATH  : specify where the castem has been installed
  CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE : specify a tool chain file
  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE     : two values are supported 'Release' and 'Debug'
