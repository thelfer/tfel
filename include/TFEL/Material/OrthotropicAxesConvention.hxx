   * Most finite element solver can't have a uniq definition of the
   * orthotropic axes for all the modelling hypotheses. One thus
   * need to define a convention. This leads to many troubles when
   * trying to define an the hill tensor or the thermal expansion.
   *
   * For example, one can define a pipe using the following axes
   * definition:
   * - \f$\left(rr,zz,tt,...\right)\f$ in \f$3D\f$, \f$2D\f$
   *   axysymmetric, \f$1D\f$ axisymmetric generalised plane strain
   *   or generalised plane stress.
   * - \f$\left(rr,tt,zz,...\right)\f$ in \f$2D\f$ plane stress,
   *   strain, generalized plane strain.
   *
   * This means that we have to exchange the second and third axis
   * when changing from \f$3D\f$ to \f$2D\f$ plane strain. This is
   * the PIPE (orthotropic axes) convention.
   *
   * The various classes and functions that take an
   * `OrthotropicAxesConvention` value as template parameter will
   * take the values of the material properties in the material
   * frame corresponding to the \f$3D\f$ case and internally make
   * the appropriate swaps when necessary.

     *     - The first material axis is given by the radius of the pipe.
     *     - The second material axis is given by the axis of the pipe.
     * - in \f$2D\f$ plane stress, strain, generalized plane strain:
     *     - The first material axis is given by the radius of the pipe.
     *     - The second material axis is perpendicual to the radius of
     *       the pipe and to the axis of the pipe.
     *
     *   In other words, the second and third axes are exchanged
