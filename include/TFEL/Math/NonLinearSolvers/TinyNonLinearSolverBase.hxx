   * \brief A base class for algorithms dedicated to solve finite sized system
   * of non linear equations.
   * \tparam N: size of the system of non linear equations.
   * \tparam NumericType: numeric type.
   * \tparam Child: base class.
   * \tparam ExternalWorkSpace: class containing data members used by the
   * solver.
   *
   * By default, the `Child` class must:
   *
   * 1. Set the values of `epsilon` and `iterMax` data members and the initial
   * guess of the unknowns, i.e. by setting the value of the `zeros` data
   * member.
   * 2. Provide a method called `computeResidual` which must computes
   * the residual, i.e. the data member `fzeros`  using the current estimate of
   * the solution, i.e. the data member `zeros`. When meaningful, this method
   * may also compute the jacobian matrix, i.e. the data member `jacobian`.
   *
   * This class has numerous customisation points:
   *
   * - `checkConvergence`: checks if convergence is achieved.
   * - `processNewEstimate`: this method is called at the beginning of the
   * `resolution and each time the estimate of the solution is updated. The
   * default implementation does nothing.
   * - `rejectCurrentCorrection`: this method is meant to
   * be overloaded by the `Child` class to handle the rejection of the current
   * correction. The default implementation does nothing.
   * - `reportBeginningOfResolution`: this method is meant to be overloaded by
   * the `Child` class to trace the beginning of the resolution. The default
   * implementation does nothing.
   * - `reportSuccess`: this method is meant to be overloaded by the `Child`
   * class to report a successfull resolution. The default implementation does
   * nothing.
   * - `reportFailure`: this method is meant to be overloaded by the `Child`
   * class to report the resolution fails because the maximal number of
   * iterations has been reached. The default implementation does nothing.
   * - `reportInvalidResidualEvaluation`:  this method is meant to
   * be overloaded by the `Child` class to report that the residual evaluation
   * failed. The default implementation does nothing.
   * - `reportNewCorrectionComputationFailure`: this method is meant to
   * be overloaded by the `Child` class to report the failure of the computation
   * of a new correction.
