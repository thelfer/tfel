 *
 * `TFEL` is a collaborative development of
 * [CEA](http://www.cea.fr/english-portal "Commissariat à l'énergie
 * atomique") and [EDF](http://www.edf.com/ "Électricité de France").
 *
 * The official website of the `TFEL` project is the following:
 * <https://thelfer.github.io/tfel/web/index.html>.
 *
 * # Overview
 * 
 * The `TFEL` project provides:
 * - `mfront`: a code generator for material properties, mechanical
 *   behaviours and simple models.
 * - `mtest`: a simple mechanical solver able to simulate:
 *     - the behaviour of a single point
 *     - the behaviour of a pipe
 * - `TFEL/Math`: a set of classes used in mechanical
 *   implementations of mechanical behaviours and various algorithms.
 *   Mechanical operations are handled using expression templates.
 * - `TFEL/Material`: classes used by mechanical behaviours
 * - `TFEL/Utilities`: various classes, including the `CxxTokenizer`
 *   class.
 * - `TFEL/Metaprogramming`: a set of classes to ease metaprogramming.
 * - `TFEL/Typetraits`: a set of classes providing information on types
 * - `TFEL/System`: intefaces to system specific operations on file and
 *    threads and processes
 *  
 * # History
 * 
 * - Versions prior to 0.1 were developed by T. Helfer as an
 *   independent project.
 * - Starting with version 1.0, TFEL was developed as a sub-project of
 *   the PLEIADES platform.
 * - Versions higher than 2.0 are open-source.
 *
 * # TFEL/MFront licence 
 *
 * `TFEL` version prior to 0.1 were released under both the LGPL and
 * the CECILL-B licences. A copy of those licences are included in the
 * distributions of `TFEL`.
 * 
 * `TFEL` versions 1.x were developped by CEA within the PLEIADES
 * project. Since svn revision 584, TFEL was part of the `PLEIADES`
 * projet.
 * 
 * Starting from versions 2.x, `TFEL` has been publicly released under
 * either the GPL or the CECILL-A licence. A copy of thoses licences
 * are delivered with the sources of `TFEL`. CEA or EDF may also
 * distribute this project under specific licensing conditions.
