The `@PhysicalBounds` keyword let the use define the physical domain
of a variable.

The `@PhysicalBounds` keyword is followed by a variable name, the
keyword in and an interval. The interval may contain the infinity,
represented by the '*' character.

### Effect

In implicit schemes, if physical bounds are set on a integration
variable, this variable is bounded to satisfy them during the internal
iterations.

If a variable is found to be out of its physical bounds, the
computations are stopped. The tests are performed at different stages
of the integration depending on the nature of the variable.

### Example

~~~~{.cpp}
// a temperature (in Kelvin) can't be negative
@Bounds T in [0:*[;
