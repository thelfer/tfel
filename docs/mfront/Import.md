The `@Import` keyword allows the inclusion of one or several
(external) mfront files. This keyword is followed by a string or an
array of strings. Each string stands for a mfront file name that is
meant to be imported.

This instruction interrupts the treatment of the current file and
starts the sequential treatment of each file to be imported.

## Search paths

Files to be imported are searched, in that order:

- starting from the current directory.
- starting from directories specified with one of the `--search-path`
  or the `--include` (`-I`) `mfront`' command line options.
- staring from directories specified through the `MFRONT_INCLUDE_PATH`
  environment variable.

## Example

~~~~{.cpp}
@Import "SlidingSystemsCC.mfront";
