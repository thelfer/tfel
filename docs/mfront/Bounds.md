The `@Bounds` keyword let the user define the domain of validity of
the law.

The `@Bounds` keyword is followed by a variable name, the keyword in
and an interval. The interval may contain the infinity, represented by
the '*' character.

### Effect

What happens if a variable if found to be out of its bounds depends on
the interface used. Most interfaces let the user choose one of three
following policies:

- `None`, which means that nothing is done.
- `Warning`, which means that a message is displayed, but computations
  are not stopped.
- `Strict`, which means that computations are stopped with an error
  message.

### Example

~~~~{.cpp}
@Bounds T in [293.15:873.15];
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
