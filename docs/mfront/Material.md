The `@Material` keyword let the user specify which material is treated
by the current file. This keyword is followed by the name of the
material.

This name must be a valid `C++` identifier. The following characters
are legal as the first character of an identifier, or any subsequent
character:

`_` `a` `b` `c` `d` `e` `f` `g` `h` `i` `j` `k` `l` `m`
`n` `o` `p` `q` `r` `s` `t` `u` `v` `w` `x` `y` `z`
`A` `B` `C` `D` `E` `F` `G` `H` `I` `J` `K` `L` `M`
`N` `O` `P` `Q` `R` `S` `T` `U` `V` `W` `X` `Y` `Z`

The following characters are legal as any character in an identifier
except the first:

`0` `1` `2` `3` `4` `5` `6` `7` `8` `9`
