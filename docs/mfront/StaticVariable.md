The `@StaticVariable` keyword let the user define a constant
value. Unlike parameters (see the `@Parameter` keyword), static
variables' values can't be changed after compilation.

This keyword must be followed by the type of the constant, its name,
an equal sign and its value.

## Example

~~~~{.cpp}
@StaticVariable real A = 1.234e56;
~~~~
