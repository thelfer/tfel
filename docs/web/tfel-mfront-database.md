The `TFELMFrontDatabase` library provides the `MFrontDatabase` class
which allows to analyse libraries generated by `MFront`. More precisely,
this class allows to retrieve and filters the so-called **entry points**
generated by `MFront` in a set of libraries. An entry point can be
associated with a behaviour, a material property or a point-wise model.

> **Notes**

> This class is barely a convenient wrapper around
> `tfel::system::ExternalLibraryManager`. A typical
> use case of `MFrontDatabase` is to select a
> behaviour associated with a given material
> and load it in `MTest` or analyse it with 
> `tfel::system::ExternalLibraryManager`.

# Overview

## Entry points

The `MFrontDatabase::EntryPoint` structure contains:

- the type of material knowledge described (behaviour, material property
  or point-wise model),
- the name of the entry point,
- the library in which the entry point is defined.
- the name of the source file used to generate the entry point.
