When subjected to a wide range of environmental loading conditions, basalt exhibits inelastic deformation characteristics ranging from brittle to ductile behavior. In this manuscript, we present a new constitutive model of basalt that spans the brittle-ductile transition by covering a wide range of mean effective stress, temperature, and strain rate. The model has been implemented into the automatic constitutive model code generator {MFront}, which we have coupled with the finite element solver {OpenGeoSys}. The software employed for the computations is open source, accessible and offers a versatile solution to model thermomechanical failure of rocks. Within this framework, we have performed numerical simulations that highlight the localization of strains and stresses under triaxial compression. Predictions of the constitutive response, of the depth of the brittle-ductile transition, and of the localization patterns are in agreement with laboratory and in situ observations. The results have important geophysical implications as they provide a constitutive basis that explains the mechanisms through which basalt can deform in a brittle fashion at temperatures above 600°C.},

Résumé
Des essais de traction-compression sont réalisés sur des bicristaux de cuivre dont le joint est parallèle à l'axe de traction. La caractérisation des systèmes de glissement actifs est effectuée par des observations au microscope de la surface des éprouvettes. Un modèle de viscoplasticité cristalline est identifié sur les essais de monocristal, puis utilisé dans un programme de calcul par éléments finis pour prévoir le comportement du bicristal. La simulation numérique est en bon accord avec la courbe globale force-déplacement, et procure aussi une bonne description des systèmes de glissement actifs.
Zusammenfassung
Druck- und Zugversuche wurden an Bikristallen aus Kupfer durchgeführt, deren Grenze parallel zur Zugachse verlief. Die Gleitsysteme werden durch mikroskopische Untersuchungen der Probenoberfläche ermittelt. Ein viskoplastiches Modell unter Berücksichtigung der Gleitsysteme wird ausgehend von Versuchen an Einkristallen erstellt, und wird in einem {FE}-Programm verwendet, um das Verhalten des Bikristalles zu bestimmen. Die numerische Simulation stimmt weitgehend mit dem Maschinendiagramm (Kraft- Verlängerung der Probe) überein, und liefert auch eine befriedigende Beschreibung der aktiven Gleitsysteme.},

The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently. Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk.},

However, the effects of the specific post-irradiation deformation mechanisms on the mechanical behavior are not clearly understood and modeled. Based on experimental results it is discussed that the kinematic strain hardening is increased by the plastic strain localization inside the dislocation channels as well as the only basal slip activation observed for specific mechanical tests. From this analysis, the first polycrystalline model is developed for irradiated zirconium alloys, taking into account the irradiation induced hardening, the intra-granular softening as well as the intra-granular kinematic strain hardening due to the plastic strain localization inside the channels. This physically based model reproduces the mechanical behavior in agreement with the slip systems observed. In addition, this model reproduces the Bauschinger effect observed during low cycle fatigue as well as the cyclic strain softening.},

The data are further interpreted in a continuum mechanics, finite strain framework, in both one and two–dimensional geometries, whence stress and oxygen partial pressure exponents of the creep law are estimated. The stress exponent is indicative of power–law creep. The oxygen partial pressure exponent is consistent with a strain–rate limited by vacancy mediated self–diffusion of the slowest moving ion, suggesting a climb–controlled recovery process. Some samples are further characterized using {SEM}/{EBSD} which reveals signs of plastic deformation typical of recovery creep. The effect of oxygen pressure upon microstructure is discussed.},

This paper presents a novel efficient and robust phase field algorithm for quasi-static brittle fracture analysis. This algorithm overcomes two major issues that affect significantly the numerical cost of the method: the treatment of discontinuous crack propagation and the inequality constraint associated with the irreversibility of the damage evolution. To handle discontinuous crack propagation, a semi-implicit scheme, which combines the usual explicit and implicit schemes, is proposed. Different from explicit schemes that require small time steps and purely implicit schemes that lose immediately efficiency when encountering discontinuous propagation, the proposed method can alleviate the steps constraint while keeping a good robustness with discontinuous cracking. Concerning the irreversibility constraint, this work proposes a practical and easy-to-implement method. It is shown that this method is extremely efficient and robust without any supplementary numerical coefficient. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated by means of representative numerical examples.},

A typical application for such kind of problems is finite-strain elastoplasticity which we address using a total Lagrangian formulation based on logarithmic strain measures. The proposed interior-point algorithm is implemented and tested on 3D examples involving plastic collapse and geometrical changes. Comparison with classical Newton-Raphson/return mapping methods shows that the interior-point method exhibits good computational performance , especially in terms of convergence robustness. Similarly to what is observed for convex small-strain plasticity, the interior-point method is able to converge for much larger load steps than classical methods.},

More generally we consider the problem of a hollow sphere under hydrostatic tension when the constitutive material of the sphere is already porous. The solution is used in a self-consistent scheme and a differential scheme to derive a constitutive law for a porous material containing different populations of micro-voids with distributed sizes. These schemes predict a higher damage effect for the same porosity than the models based on a single size of voids.

	abstract = {Explicitly modeling slip bands is a promising method to simulate the consequences of intragranular plastic slip localization on the behavior of strongly localizing crystals such as irradiated metals. In this study, we propose a very efficient framework to implement this modeling strategy based on a massively parallel {FFT}-based solver enhanced with composite voxels to simulate polycrystals with a regular lamellar structure alternating plastic slip bands embedded within larger elastic bands. To this end, generic composite voxel models have been formulated and implemented, allowing to extend the approach to any type of constitutive behavior in the future. In particular, we show that laminate composite voxels are particularly well suited to improve standard {FFT}-based solvers in this context, and enable to run polycrystalline simulations accurately accounting for slip bands whose width is two orders of magnitude below the grain size. To demonstrate the potential of this approach, we apply it to an idealized material designed to approximate basal channeling in irradiated textured Zr alloys. Varying the width and the spacing of the modeled slip bands, we show that it allows to capture the increase of grain boundary normal stress concentrations or the enhanced Bauschinger effect induced by an increased localization of plastic slip.},

Dans ce document, nous nous sommes attaches à construire une classe de modèles allant du modèle d'endommagement isotrope à celui anisotrope (le plus général possible). Ce modèle reproduit certaines caractéristiques physiques observées expérimentalement sur les matériaux adoucissants tel que le béton. La méthode de décomposition de l'endommagement sur des microplans permet de décliner le même type de modèle en une version isotrope et une version anisotrope. Cette méthode est basée sur l'établissement des lois de comportement sur les microplans.

Expérimentalement, les courbes de résistance obtenues dans le cadre de la Mécanique Linéaire Élastique de la Rupture équivalente attestent d’un phénomène de confinement précoce de la zone d’élaboration manifestement lié à la géométrie testée et aux propriétés du béton étudié.Les simulations numériques obtenues sur la base du modèle d’endommagement sont en accord avec les résultats expérimentaux et conduisent également à soupçonner ce phénomène de confinement. Par la suite, la simulation numérique est à nouveau utilisée sur cette même géométrie de spécimen mais en réduisant les propriétés de rupture de la matrice cimentaire afin de diminuer la taille de la zone d’élaboration. Les résultats de cette nouvelle simulation montrent un développement libre de la zone d’élaboration suivie d’une propagation auto-similaire de la fissure principale attestée par la présence d’un régime plateau de la courbe de résistance correspondante.Une analyse détaillée du champ d’endommagement puis du champ d’énergie restituée est réalisée et permet de mettre en évidence un critère de développement de la zone d’élaboration fondée sur une valeur maximale du taux local de restitution d’énergie d’endommagement.},

	abstract = {When subjected to high temperatures, concrete exhibits a load-dependent thermal strain known as load induced thermal strain ({LITS}) or transient thermal creep ({TTC}). {LITS} phenomena can be important in prestressed concrete structures, as its evolution under transient thermal conditions can potentially lead to both loss in pre-stress and residual tensile stress development. Hence, such structures may evolve damage and loss of rigidity when subjected to high temperature thermal loading cycles. Whilst {LITS} models have recently become available in the public domain, they cannot capture damage from mechanical loading. Indeed, whilst most relevant damage models partially capture damage mechanisms of concrete, they do not adequately capture anisotropy and inelasticity in addition to the unilateral effect exhibited by concrete, ie the Mazars damage model. However, the recently developed Fichant-La Borderie ({FLB}) damage model has shown that these additional effects can be captured making the {FLB} model suitable to capture mechanical damage and {LITS} effects. In this paper, a method for coupling a {LITS} model with a {FLB} model is proposed. Numerical studies demonstrate that this model has the potential to enable accurate assessment of structural damage from transient thermal events, such as fire.},

The model parameters used in this study were calibrated based in the experimental data collected from a set of experimental tests.
Comparative studies of monitoring data and simulations showed good agreement between measured settlements and computed settlements, allowing to predict the deformation of the structure in the next 10 years.

It is well known that these singularities often cause stress integration schemes to perform inefficiently or fail. This paper describes a simple hyperbolic surface can be generalized to a family of Mohr-Coulomb yield crietria which are also rounded in the octahedral plane, thus eliminating the singularities that occur at the edge intersections as well. This type of yield surface is both continuous and differentiable at all stress states, and can be made to approximate the Mohr-Coulomb yield function as closely as required by adjusting two parameters. The yield surface and its gradients are presented in a form which is suitable for finite element programming with either explicit or implicit stress intergration schemes. Two efficient FORTRAN 77 subroutines are given to illustrate how the yield surafce can be implemented in practice.},

	abstract = {Addressing the major challenges of software productivity and performance portability becomes necessary to take advantage of emerging extreme-scale computing architectures. As software development costs will continuously increase to deal with exascale hardware issues, higher-level programming abstractions will facilitate the path to go. There is a growing demand for new programming environments in order to improve scientific productivity, to ease design and implementation, and to optimize large production codes. We introduce the numerical analysis specific language Nabla (∇) which improves applied mathematicians productivity, and enables new algorithmic developments for the construction of hierarchical composable high-performance scientific applications. One of the key concept is the introduction of the hierarchical logical time within the high-performance computing scientific community. It represents an innovation that addresses major exascale challenges. This new dimension to parallelism is explicitly expressed to go beyond the classical single-program multiple-data or bulk-synchronous parallel programming models. Control and data concurrencies are combined consistently to achieve statically analyzable transformations and efficient code generation. Shifting the complexity to the compiler offers an ease of programming and a more intuitive approach, while reaching the ability to target new hardware and leading to performance portability. In this paper, we present the three main parts of the ∇ toolchain: the frontend raises the level of abstraction with its grammar; the backends hold the effective generation stages, and the middle-end provides agile software engineering practices transparently to the application developer, such as: instrumentation (performance analysis, V\&V, debugging at scale), data or resource optimization techniques (layout, locality, prefetching, caches awareness, vectorization, loop fusion) and the management of the hierarchical logical time, which produces the graphs of all parallel tasks. The refactoring of existing legacy scientific applications is also possible by the incremental compositional approach of the method.},

	abstract = {Background and objective
Abdominal hernia repair is one of the most often performed surgical procedures worldwide. Numerical simulations of the abdominal wall mechanics can be a valuable tool to devise actions aimed at preventing hernia formation. A first step towards this goal is the development of consistent constitutive models for the tissues that form the human abdominal wall. In this study we propose, for each of the tissues involved, a new formulation of the so–called transversely isotropic hyperelastic model ({TIHM}).
Methods
We propose a new {TIHM} for the human abdominal wall tissues and we present a systemic view of the methodology that we have implemented in the present study. First we consider the mathematical background of the {TIHM}. The novelty of our formulation is that both the isotropic and the fiber contributions to the strain energy function are characterized exclusively by polynomial convex functions of certain invariant quantities. Then, we provide a detailed description on how the constitutive model is implemented into an open source finite element ({FE}) software. In our approach we use the specific interface provided by the {MFront} software to incorporate our {TIHM} formulation into the Code Aster {FE} solver. For each of the tissues considered, the values of the {TIHM} constants are adjusted by means of a numerical simulation of previous experimental data from tensile tests.
Results
We studied the following abdominal wall tissues: linea alba, rectus sheath, external oblique muscle, internal oblique muscle, transversus abdominis muscle and rectus abdominis muscle. Our formulation closely reproduces tensile test data for each tissue in the corresponding {FE} numerical simulation.
Conclusions
The new {TIHM} formulation is suitable for a future numerical investigation of the abdominal wall, which will in turn help us to assess the best zone to practice a colostomy. The methodology implemented in the present study can be easily extended in the future to develop and implement a {TIHM} for active muscles and/or a different type of constitutive model which might be suitable to characterize other tissues of biomedical interest.},

A generic strain softening model is implemented within a massively parallel {FFT} solver framework to study intragranular strain localization throughout high resolution polycrystalline simulations. It is coupled to a systematic analysis strain localization modes: Equivalent plastic strain and lattice rotation fields are processed to create binary maps of slip and kink bands populations, estimate their volume fraction and mean strain level. High resolution simulations show the formation of an intragranular localization band network. The associated localization maps are used to identify accurately slip and kink bands populations and highlight the distinct evolution of kink bands, influenced by lattice rotation. Results highlight that the analysis of the nature of localization bands in numerical studies is fundamental to asses the validity of polycrystalline simulations. Indeed, it is evidenced that selection between slip or kink localization modes is only due to grain to grain incompatibilities as these two localization modes are equivalent in classical crystal plasticity models. As a result they predict the formation of a large amount of kink bands in contradiction with experimental observations of softening metals. We show that this holds for complex physics based models too. Hence, the use of classical crystal plasticity for strain localization simulation should be reconsidered in order to predict realistic localization modes.},

Les cas tridimensionnel et contraintes planes ont été étudiés où nous avons testé les performances de trois méthodes d’intégration différentes. Une fois la formulation et l’intégration réalisées, nous avons validé la justesse de nos équations constitutives avec des calculs sur un point d’intégration. Ensuite, des calculs sur des structures industrielles (éprouvette thermique, culasse monocylindre et culasse trois cylindres) sont effectués sur le code élément fini {ABAQUS} afin de nous assurer de la convergence rapide et systématique du modèle, de vérifier les équations constitutives de ce dernier et de comparer la méthodologie actuelle du groupe {PSA} avec celles proposées par {MFront}.

abstractNote = {Sintering refers to a manufacturing process through which mechanically pressed bodies of ceramic (and sometimes metal) powders are heated to drive densification thereby removing the inherit porosity of green bodies. As the body densifies through the sintering process, the ensuing material flow leads to macroscopic deformations of the specimen and as such the final configuration differs form the initial. Therefore, as with any manufacturing step, there is substantial interest in understanding and being able to model the sintering process to predict deformation and residual stress. Efforts in this regard have been pursued for face seals, gear wheels, and consumer products like wash-basins. To understand the sintering process, a variety of modeling approaches have been pursued at different scales.},

Computation of the geometry of the part after sintering helps the manufacturer to reduce these by modifying the pressing tools, thus avoiding expensive hard machining of each part. In the present paper, the results of a finite-element analysis of the process steps uniaxial dry pressing of a cylinder and sintering after green machining are reported. High density gradients after pressing are calculated near the die wall. The sintering simulation predicts a severe deformation of the dense cylinder and reveals the beneficial effect of removing regions of non-uniform density by green machining. The final shapes of simulated and sintered geometries are in good agreement."

The developed numerical approach is able to address the energy efficiency, the fuel consumption as well as the pollutant emissions and the quality of the final product. The model of the ceramic kiln is based on a lumped and distributed parameter model and accounts for the heat and mass transfer phenomena that take place in the real components under actual operating conditions of the systems. Models for the simulation of the different components that are used for the kiln functioning are included in the modelling, such as the burners, the fan, the valves and the control system. The numerical approach demonstrates to predict accurately the temperature distribution of both the tiles and the hot gases along the kiln length. Numerical results are validated against experimental measurements carried out on a real kiln during regular production operations. Additionally, the calculated temperature profile of the tiles is employed to predict the mechanical stresses that form in the ceramic product within the kiln. A thermomechanical model is adopted to determine the curvature and residual stresses in the tiles and particular care is devoted to the final stresses that remain at the end of the kiln since they affect the quality of product. The developed numerical approach demonstrates to be an efficient tool for investigating different control strategies to optimize the kiln thermal behaviour as well as the tile quality. On the basis of the fluid-dynamics and thermomechanical numerical approaches, a modified operating strategy for the kiln's cooling section is proposed to minimize the tiles' residual stresses and the modified cooling profile resulted to be in the operating range of the real kiln."

High-precision applications demand absolute signal accuracies below 30 Pa on chips well below 1 mm scales, while the requirement of factory calibration before soldering demands highly temperature stable adhesives. An experimentally verified, finite-element-based simulation model is used to investigate static and hysteretic stresses in the sensor, demonstrating a large potential for the reduction of temperature-dependent stresses affecting the signal, including hysteretic stresses. This is achieved by the determination of adhesive geometries that allow stress compensation, balancing opposing adverse stresses to cancel out. Using this approach, it is demonstrated that the signal hysteresis can be significantly reduced, while maintaining critical characteristics such as sensitivity and size.},

	abstract = {Describing accurately the creep behavior of concrete is of significant importance for the evaluation of the long-term performance of structures. In this regard, a finer characterization of mesostructure effects and material non-linearity provides very insightful information. In this work, the effects of aggregate shapes on the creep response are studied using numerical simulations on 3D mesoscopic samples. The main focus is put on the assessment of the representativeness of generated samples versus real specimens obtained by tomography. Several mesostructures are generated by randomly distributing aggregates with different geometries, from simple spheres to realistic ones extracted from tomography. Creep simulations with finite element ({FE}) and Fast Fourier Transform ({FFT}) methods are then performed on different spatial refinements. Moreover, a classical linear viscoelastic ({VE}) and a viscoelastic-viscoplastic ({VE}-{VP}) behavior able to reproduce non-recoverable strains are adopted for describing the matrix behavior, to assess the relevance of a more accurate model. It is shown that numerical samples generated with tomographic aggregates may be regarded as a good approximation of the real specimen, while more ‘isotropic’ shapes, especially spherical, lead to significant differences at both local and macroscopic levels. Results obtained with {FE} and {FFT} methods are very close, indicating that while {FFT} is well adapted, {FE} remains attractive in this context. Finally, notable differences are observed between {VE} and {VP} response due to the development of residual strains in the matrix and correspondingly more limited strain redistribution, which indicates that {VP}-like models should be preferred to capture accurately the creep features at mesoscale.},

	abstract = {French {GENIV} sodium-cooled fast reactor ({SFR}) system could include Americium (Am) recycling in the radial fertile blankets located in the outer core regions. An issue related to this option is the lack of knowledge regarding the in-pile behaviour of the Am-bearing blanket ({AmBB}). The {DIAMINO} separate-effect experiment was irradiated in the {OSIRIS} Material Test Reactor ({MTR}) with the goal of studying {AmBB} gaseous release and swelling as a function of temperature, {AmBB} microstructure and gas production rate. A brief description of the experiment is first provided, in terms of objectives and planning. The innovative design developed for the {DIAMINO} experiment is described in details. The {DIAMINO} irradiation time history is then summarized and the first results of non-destructive post-irradiation examinations are given. The {LICOS} fuel design code of the {PLEIADES} platform was used for the thermo-mechanical modelling of the {DIAMINO} experiment. The Pleiades platform, co-developed by {CEA} and its industrial partners {EDF} and {FRAMATOME}, gathers several fuel performance codes, each generally dedicated to the fuel element of a particular nuclear system. For its part, the {LICOS} code allows performing studies on innovative fuel elements or on the design of irradiation devices for instance. The thermo-mechanical modelling of the {DIAMINO} experiment device using the {LICOS} code is detailed in the paper together with the validation of the computations on the basis of some experimental temperature measurements performed on an in-pile mock-up of the experiment. The use of the simulation tool for the monitoring of the {AmBB} sample temperature under irradiation and for the post-irradiation calculations is explained and illustrated through some examples.},

	abstract = {Voids can be observed at various scales in ductile materials, frequently of sizes lower than the grain size, leading to porous single crystals materials. Two local deformation modes of porous ductile (single crystals) materials have been identified and referred to as void growth and void coalescence, the latter being characterized by strong interactions between neighboring voids. A simple semi-analytical coalescence criterion for porous single crystals with periodic arrangement of voids is proposed using effective isotropic yield stresses associated with a criterion derived for isotropic materials. An extension of the coalescence criterion is also proposed to account for shear with respect to the coalescence plane. Effective yield stresses are defined using Taylor theory of single crystal deformation, and rely ultimately on the computation of average Taylor factors. Arbitrary sets of slip systems can be considered. The coalescence criterion is assessed through comparisons to numerical limit-analysis results performed using a Fast-Fourier-Transform based solver. A good agreement is observed between the proposed criterion and numerical results for various configurations including different sets of slip systems (Face-Centered-Cubic, Hexagonal-Close-Packed), crystal orientations, void shapes and loading conditions. The competition between void growth and void coalescence is described for specific conditions, emphasizing the strong influence of both crystal orientation and void lattice, as well as their interactions.},

Limit-analysis has been used to provide coalescence criteria that have been subsequently recast into effective macroscopic yield criteria, leading to models for porous materials valid for high porosities. Such coalescence models have remained up to now restricted to cubic or hexagonal lattices of spheroidal voids. Based on the limit-analysis kinematic approach, a methodology is first proposed to get upper-bound estimates of coalescence stress for arbitrary void shapes and lattices. Semi-analytical coalescence criteria are derived for elliptic cylinder voids in elliptic cylinder unit cells for an isotropic matrix material, and validated through comparisons to numerical limit-analysis simulations. The physical application of these criteria for realistic void shapes and lattices is finally assessed numerically.},

	abstract = {The viscoplastic behavior of uranium dioxide ({UO}2) single crystal is of great interest to perform predictive multiscale modeling of the nuclear fuel. Here, a viscoplastic model is built considering dislocation glide in ½{\textless}110{\textgreater}\{100\} and ½{\textless}110{\textgreater}\{110\} slip systems. The constitutive law parameters are determined adjusting the temperature dependency of the experimental critical resolved shear stress for both principal slip modes. Crystal plasticity finite element simulations of single crystal compression tests show a reasonable agreement with experimental viscoplastic anisotropy of {UO}2. However, for specific orientations where ½{\textless}110{\textgreater}\{111\} slip is observed experimentally, significant differences remain between experimental and computed compression stresses. Therefore, the role of ½{\textless}110{\textgreater}\{111\} slip is investigated based on a parametric study that provides new insights on {UO}2 plastic deformation. Several parameterizations of ½{\textless}110{\textgreater}\{111\} slip are tested highlighting the complexity of {UO}2 viscoplastic behavior. Significant improvements are still required to explain all simulation-experiment gaps.},

	abstract = {The {PhD} project is devoted to the study of the mechanical response of the reactor pressure vessel steel A508cl3 (or 16MND5 in French nomenclature) at the microscopic scale by experimental analyses and numerical simulations. Different aspects of in-situ tests inside an {SEM} chamber have been considered. First, the characterization and corrections of bias and uncertainties of different {SEM} imaging modalities ({SE}, {BSE}, and {EBSD}) have been performed. Precise registrations of {SEM} images in different modalities have been developed in order to give a comprehensive description of the sample surface topographies. Crystallographic orientation maps (from {EBSD} analyses) are registered to measure the crystal rotation and displacement fields along the tensile test. The elastic deformations of the surface are assessed by integrated correlation of high-resolution electron diffraction images. The 3D microstructure of the analyzed sample is revealed a posteriori by combining {FIB} milling {andEBSD} images.The experimental test is also simulated by crystal plasticity calculations on a 3D mesh created according to the 3D microstructure observed in the deformed configuration. An algorithm has been proposed to estimate its initial configuration and to identify the plastic parameters iteratively. A synthetic 2D model has been used to prove its feasibility. Two crystal plasticity laws have been validated on the 3D mesh, namely dislocation dynamics for body-centered cubic crystals and a modified version of Méric-Cailletaud model. In thepresent work finite element model updating was used to provide two sets of parameters (for ferrite and bainite) for the latter law.},

Linear transformation based anisotropic yield function, Int. J.

A short review of the Yld2004-18p relevant features is provided and the stress integration scheme for its implementation in {FE} codes is described. The simulation of the drawing process is conducted for an aluminum alloy sheet sample ({AA}2090-T3). The predicted and experimental cup height profiles (earing profiles) with six ears are shown to be in excellent agreement. Additional simulations on a ficticious material are performed in order to show that the yield function Yld2004-18p can lead to the prediction of cups with eight ears. In order to achieve these results, a sufficient number of input data are required to calculate the yield function coefficients. Finally, a simplified analytical approach that relates the earing profile to the r-value directionality is also presented in this paper. It is shown that this approach can be very useful as a first approximation of the earing profile of drawn cups.},

First, a new isotropic yield criterion with threefold rotational symmetry about the origin is proposed. This criterion is an odd function in the principal values of the stress deviator. It involves only one parameter that is expressible in terms of the yield strengths in compression and tension. Comparisons with the results of polycrystalline simulations performed by Hosford and Allen [Met. Trans. 4 (1973) 1424–1425] show that the proposed macroscopic criterion describes very well the asymmetry in yielding due to activation of twinning. Further, the extension of this isotropic criterion to orthotropy is developed. The proposed anisotropic criterion is applied to the description of the plastic response of hexagonal close packed (hcp) materials. It is shown that the proposed anisotropic criterion reproduces with great accuracy both the higher strength in tension than in compression and the higher tensile strength in the transverse direction than in the rolling direction observed in textured magnesium and magnesium alloys sheets (data after Kelly and Hosford [Trans. {TMS}-{AIME} 242 (1968) 654–661]).},

The discrete problem is written as the minimization of a broken nonlinear elastic energy where a local reconstruction of the displacement gradient is used. Two {HHO} methods are considered: a stabilized method where the gradient is reconstructed as a tensor-valued polynomial of order k and a stabilization is added to the discrete energy functional, and an unstabilized method which reconstructs a stable higher-order gradient and circumvents the need for stabilization. Both methods satisfy the principle of virtual work locally with equilibrated tractions. We present a numerical study of the two {HHO} methods on test cases with known solution and on more challenging three-dimensional test cases including finite deformations with strong shear layers and cavitating voids. We assess the computational efficiency of both methods, and we compare our results to those obtained with an industrial software using conforming finite elements and to results from the literature.

	abstract = {A decrease of fracture toughness of irradiated materials is usually observed, as reported for austenitic stainless steels in Light Water Reactors ({LWRs}) or copper alloys for fusion applications. For a wide range of applications (e.g. structural steels irradiated at low homologous temperature), void growth and coalescence fracture mechanism has been shown to be still predominant. As a consequence, a comprehensive study of the effects of irradiation-induced hardening mechanisms on void growth and coalescence in irradiated materials is required. The effects of irradiation on ductile fracture mechanisms - void growth to coalescence - are assessed in this study based on model experiments. Pure copper thin tensile samples have been irradiated with protons up to 0.01 dpa. Micron-scale holes drilled through the thickness of these samples subjected to uniaxial loading conditions allow a detailed description of void growth and coalescence. In this study, experimental data show that physical mechanisms of micron-scale void growth and coalescence are similar between the unirradiated and irradiated copper. However, an acceleration of void growth is observed in the later case, resulting in earlier coalescence, which is consistent with the decrease of fracture toughness reported in irradiated materials. These results are qualitatively reproduced with numerical simulations accounting for irradiation macroscopic hardening and decrease of strain-hardening capability.},

	abstract = {This paper proves that, given a Load-Induced Thermal Strain ({LITS}) curve able to accurately describe the uniaxial {LITS} development for a specific type of concrete and temperatures up to 500 °C, a more accurate prediction of the 3D {LITS} state is obtained through a confinement-dependent 3D implementation than through the classic confinement-independent approach. In particular, a new model is presented, obtained by extending to 3D a fourth order polynomial {LITS} derivative function in a way that allows the effects of the stress confinement to be taken into account. For comparison purposes, the same fourth order polynomial {LITS} derivative function is also implemented in 3D through the classic confinement-independent modelling approach. These constitutive relationships are adopted to model transient experiments performed on concrete subjected to constant uniaxial and biaxial compressive loads. The results show that the confinement-dependent modelling approach gives a better prediction of the {LITS} state developing in the case of biaxial compression than the classic confinement-independent approach. Finally, the validated confinement-dependent model is applied to evaluate the {LITS}-related stress redistribution taking place in a typical Prestressed Concrete Pressure Vessel ({PCPV}) subjected to heating to 500 °C and cooling back to the normal operating temperature of 50 °C. It is found that including the effects of three dimensional {LITS} behaviour has significant effects on the predicted stress states.},

As regards the latter case of transient in particular, {ALCYONE} is intended to predictively simulate the response of a fuel rod by taking account of mechanisms in a way that models the physics as closely as possible, encompassing all possible stages of the transient as well as various fuel/cladding material types and irradiation conditions of interest. On the way to complying with these objectives, {ALCYONE} development and validation shall include tests on {PWR}-{UO}2 fuel rods with advanced claddings such as M5® under “low pressure–low temperature” or “high pressure–high temperature” water coolant conditions. This article first presents {ALCYONE} V1.4 {RIA}-related features and modeling. It especially focuses on recent developments dedicated on the one hand to nonsteady water heat and mass transport and on the other hand to the modeling of grain boundary cracking-induced fission gas release and swelling. This article then compares some simulations of {RIA} transients performed on {UO}2-M5® fuel rods in flowing sodium or stagnant water coolant conditions to the relevant experimental results gained from tests performed in either the French {CABRI} or the Japanese {NSRR} nuclear transient reactor facilities. It shows in particular to what extent {ALCYONE}—starting from base irradiation conditions it itself computes—is currently able to handle both the first stage of the transient, namely the pellet-cladding mechanical interaction phase, and the second stage of the transient, should a boiling crisis occur. Areas of improvement are finally discussed with a view to simulating and analyzing further tests to be performed under prototypical {PWR} conditions within the {CABRI} International Program.

	abstract = {As an industrial facility relying on numerical simulation to improve the safety and efficiency of its electricity production units, {EDF} is committed to ensure that all the numerical simulation codes it develops and uses are correctly validated and verified. Within this context, the accuracy of floating-point operations has progressively become one of the important topics to study, especially since computing codes are exploited on ever more powerful hardware to solve ever larger problems. The Verification and Validation (V\&V) process should therefore include the monitoring of inaccuracies introduced by floating-point arithmetic, as well as the verification that they are kept within acceptable limits. In this paper, we present the verrou tool, a valgrind-based system which uses Monte Carlo Arithmetic ({MCA}) to monitor the accuracy of floating-point operations without needing to instrument the source code or even recompile it. This tool is therefore well-suited to be part of an industrial V\&V process. It has been successfully tested both on small-scale, well understood numerical applications, and on large-scale, more complex industrial computing codes.},

The dilatation of the pores and of the compressible matrix are evaluated. It is found that a large part of the total dilatation is due to plastic volume changes of the solid phase. The asymptotic stress states of the simulations are compared to analytical predictions by Shen et al. (Comput Mater Sci 62:189–194, 2012).

Metal plasticity models, in particular, have been instrumental in the development of these codes. Most plasticity models implemented in computational codes use an isotropic von Mises yield surface. The von Mises, or J2, model uses a predictor–corrector algorithm–the radial return algorithm–to integrate the model. For non-quadratic yield surfaces, including anisotropic yield surfaces, no simple algorithm exists. This paper presents and analyzes a line search algorithm for the return mapping problem that shows excellent improvement over a Newton–Raphson model. Two non-quadratic yield surfaces–one isotropic and one anisotropic–are studied in this paper. The line search algorithm used for integrating the models is shown to be reliable and robust. The theory and implementation of the models, the details of the return mapping algorithm, and results that show the effectiveness of the method are presented. Finally, a few simple boundary value problems verify the implementation and show the impact of the models. For the internal pressurization of a cylinder, the importance of modeling anisotropy correctly is shown.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on a new algorithm for the quasi-static simulation of unstable crack propagation in time-independent brittle material. The proposed approach is based on a combination of the standard Newton’s algorithm with a fictive path loading algorithm. First, a time step refinement process, associated to the Newton’s algorithm, enables us to efficiently detect the beginning of unstable crack extension. Then, a fictive path loading algorithm is performed to assess an estimation of the post instability solution. Finally, this estimated solution is used as initial guess in the standard Newton’s algorithm for the same time increment. The final converged solution satisfies both the mechanical equilibrium and the mechanical behaviour integration. This paper highlights several advantages of the proposed algorithm such as robustness, easy implementation on an existing Newton’s type solver, genericity for different unstable nonlinear physical problems. An application of this new method is presented for a smeared crack model, based on a local continuous damage formulation, devoted to the simulation of brittle nuclear fuel rupture. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through a set of 2d and 3d simulation results.},

	abstract = {Till now, it was widely believed that the dislocation strengthening coefficients used in the Taylor-like relation were universal for a given crystallographic class of materials. In the present study, it is shown that this is actually untrue because of two effects that influence the strength of interactions between slip systems, namely the value of the Poisson ratio and the occurrence of doubly degenerated, asymmetric, junction configurations. New strengthening coefficient values for reactions between slip systems were determined using dislocation dynamics simulations on five representative {FCC} metals, plus germanium, and on five {BCC} transition metals for \{110\} and \{112\} slip systems at high homologous temperatures. The value of the Poisson ratio affects all the strengthening coefficients to various extents ranging from small to substantial. The effects of configuration asymmetry and Poisson's ratio are more marked in {BCC} metals than in {FCC} metals. These two major effects arise from a number of concurring dislocation mechanisms, which are discussed in some detail. It is expected that the use of accurate material-dependent coefficients will notably improve the predictive ability of current models for strain hardening.},

These heterogeneous materials are assumed to be composed of thermoelastic aggregates distributed in a linear thermoviscoelastic matrix; moreover, the Interfacial Transition Zones ({ITZ}) between aggregates and matrix, whose behavior is also considered as linear thermoviscoelastic, are explicitly introduced. The numerical specimens consist in unstructured periodic meshes containing polyhedral aggregates with various size and shapes randomly distributed in a box. Zero-thickness interface finite elements are introduced between aggregates and matrix to model the {ITZ}. Macroscopic response and averaged stresses and strains in the matrix and aggregate phases are compared to analytical estimations obtained with classical mean-field approximation schemes applied in the Laplace–Carson space, in which the {ITZ} are introduced via imperfect interfaces modeled with the Linear Spring Model ({LSM}). The effects of {ITZ} thickness, aggregate shape and uniform temperature increase are then studied to evaluate their respective influence on the local and macroscopic creep behavior of mortar and concrete. Globally, it is found that the model response is in relatively good agreement with numerical simulations results, and that as expected while the {ITZ} do not affect significantly the concrete behavior, they have a non-negligible impact on the mortar one.},

Revisiting brittle fracture as an energy minimization problem. J. Mech. Phys. Solids 46 (8), 1319–1342]. We focus on the linear elastic case where the contact condition appears as a local unilateral constraint on the displacement jump at the crack surfaces. The regularized model is obtained by splitting the strain energy in a spherical and a deviatoric parts and accounting for the sign of the local volume change. The numerical implementation is based on a standard finite element discretization and on the adaptation of an alternate minimization algorithm used in previous works. The new regularization avoids crack interpenetration and predicts asymmetric results in traction and in compression. Even though we do not exhibit any gamma-convergence proof toward the desired limit behavior, we illustrate through several numerical case studies the pertinence of the new model in comparison to other approaches.},

The method is dedicated to voxel-based models of highly complex microstructures, as obtained from X-ray microtomography images. A smoothed displacement jump approximation is introduced by means of level-set functions to overcome the issue of pixelized interfaces in voxel-based models. A simple technique is proposed to construct the level-set function in that case. Compared to recent work aiming at modeling cohesive cracks within the phase field method, our framework differs in several points: the formulation is such that interfaces are not initially damaged; no additional variables are required to describe the discontinuities at the interface and fatigue cracks can be modeled. The technique allows interaction between bulk and interface cracks, e.g. nucleation from interfaces and propagation within the matrix, and for arbitrary geometries and interactions between cracks. Several benchmarks are presented to validate the model. The technique is illustrated through numerical examples involving complex microcracking in X-ray {CT} image-based models of concrete microstructures.},

This can be overcome by a diffusive crack modeling based on the introduction of a crack phase field. Following our recent work [C. Miehe, F. Welschinger, M. Hofacker, Thermodynamically-consistent phase field models of fracture: Variational principles and multi-field fe implementations, International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering {DOI}:10.1002/nme.2861] on phase-field-type fracture, we propose in this paper a new variational framework for rate-independent diffusive fracture that bases on the introduction of a local history field. It contains a maximum reference energy obtained in the deformation history, which may be considered as a measure for the maximum tensile strain obtained in history. It is shown that this local variable drives the evolution of the crack phase field. The introduction of the history field provides a very transparent representation of the balance equation that governs the diffusive crack topology. In particular, it allows for the construction of a new algorithmic treatment of diffusive fracture. Here, we propose an extremely robust operator split scheme that successively updates in a typical time step the history field, the crack phase field and finally the displacement field. A regularization based on a viscous crack resistance that even enhances the robustness of the algorithm may easily be added. The proposed algorithm is considered to be the canonically simple scheme for the treatment of diffusive fracture in elastic solids. We demonstrate the performance of the phase field formulation of fracture by means of representative numerical examples.},

	abstract = {A very common problem in science is the numerical diagonalization of symmetric or hermitian 3x3 matrices. Since standard "black box" packages may be too inefficient if the number of matrices is large, we study several alternatives. We consider optimized implementations of the Jacobi, {QL}, and Cuppen algorithms and compare them with an analytical method relying on Cardano's formula for the eigenvalues and on vector cross products for the eigenvectors. Jacobi is the most accurate, but also the slowest method, while {QL} and Cuppen are good general purpose algorithms. The analytical algorithm outperforms the others by more than a factor of 2, but becomes inaccurate or may even fail completely if the matrix entries differ greatly in magnitude. This can mostly be circumvented by using a hybrid method, which falls back to {QL} if conditions are such that the analytical calculation might become too inaccurate. For all algorithms, we give an overview of the underlying mathematical ideas, and present detailed benchmark results.

	title = {Using Anderson algorithm to accelerate {fft} based methods},
	abstract = {{FFT}-based methods[1] have been developed in the 1990s for simulating the mechanical properties of heterogeneous materials. They are based on an iterative resolution of the Lippman-Schwinger equation, solved in the Spectral Domain by Fast Fourier Transforms ({FFT}). With the originally proposed algorithm (basic algorithm), the convergence rate appeared to be proportional to the contrast between the phases properties. For high contrasts composites (even infinite for porous material), accelerated algorithms have thus been proposed (Milton \& Eyre, Michel \& al., Monchiet)[2] to increase the convergence rate. Other new algorithms[3] are based on a combination of the conjugate gradient and {FFT} methods. In this presentation, a new accelerated scheme has been proposed [7] (and introduced in the {AMITEX}\_FFTP code [8]): it uses the Anderson extrapolation method [4,5], which has already been used by the finite element code {CAST}3M[6], for non-linear materials, to increase the convergence rate when the tangent matrix is unknown. Used in a {FFT} based algorithm, it conserves its versatility towards non-linear materials. This new algorithm is compared to the previous accelerated schemes.},

This goal is achieved by mixing fine simulations and numerical methods such as impulse response and data assimilation.

	abstract = {The paper presents a novel thermomechanical 3D Load-Induced Thermal Strain ({LITS}) model that captures the experimentally demonstrated behavior of concrete in the case of heating under multiaxial mechanical load, for temperatures up to 250 °C. In contrast to the models available in the literature, the new model takes into account the observed dependency of {LITS} on stress confinement. Such a dependency is introduced through a confinement coefficient which makes {LITS} directly proportional to the confinement of the stress state. Also, a new practical bilinear {LITS} model is proposed and proved to be suitable for fitting the general trend of the curves experimentally obtained for different loading conditions. The presented model is embedded in a thermoelastic material constitutive law, and then verified and validated against experiments performed on concrete specimens subjected to transient temperatures up to 250 °C under uniaxial, biaxial and triaxial compressive stress states. Once calibrated and validated, the constitutive model is used to evaluate the effects of {LITS} on the structural behavior of a Prestressed Concrete Pressure Vessel ({PCPV}) of a typical Advanced Gas cooled Reactor ({AGR}) subjected to a heating-cooling cycle simulating a temporary fault in its cooling system. The results of this study indicate that the development of {LITS} significantly influences the stress redistribution in the structure. Moreover, it is shown that in the case of {PCPVs} (and by extension similar structures) it is crucial to consider the {LITS} dependence on the stress confinement.},

The numerical specimens consist in unstructured periodic meshes of polyhedral aggregates with various size and shapes randomly distributed in a box. Specific interface finite elements are introduced between aggregates and matrix to model the {ITZ}. Both matrix and {ITZ} are considered as linear thermoviscoelastic materials. Averaged stresses and strains in the matrix and aggregate phases are compared to analytical estimations obtained with classical mean-field approximation schemes applied in the Laplace-Carson space, where the {ITZ} are introduced via imperfect interfaces modelled with the Linear Spring Model ({LSM}). The effects of {ITZ} thickness, aggregate shape and temperature are then studied to evaluate their respective influence on mortar and concrete creep behavior.},

A smeared crack model is proposed to have a continuous description of crack nucleation and growth at macroscopic scale. This unified description is based on crack extension process from the microscopic scale up to the macroscopic scale. In order to deal with unstable crack extension a specific algorithm is proposed to solve the quasi static nonlinear mechanical problem. A 3D application is presented to illustrate performances and robustness of the smeared crack approach to simulate crack extension in nuclear fuel ceramics. In this application with an internal pressure loading a new methodology is proposed in order to avoid convergence problem due to the indetermination of the quasi static formulation of a softening material equilibrium under Neumann boundary condition.},

C’est une problématique majeure pour l’exploitation à long terme et l’extension de la durée de vie des {BR} tout en respectant les exigences de sûreté. La taille de telles structures et la complexité de tous les phénomènes couplés qui interagissent à différentes échelles rendent difficile la mise au point d’un outil industriel opérationnel de modélisation. Dans ce contexte, cette thèse introduit une stratégie numérique de prévision du taux de fuite des {EI} en exploitation. Elle repose sur une discrétisation adaptée par macroéléments, sur une modélisation thermo-hydro-mécanique chainée faiblement couplée physiquement représentative et sur un élément fini 3D spécialement conçu pour calculer les transferts à travers le béton insaturé et fissuré. La stratégie proposée a été appliquée à la maquette d’enceinte {VeRCoRs} (échelle 1/3) : les résultats obtenus sont validés avec les données expérimentales disponibles jusqu’au premier essai de mise sous pression puis prolongés jusqu’au troisième.La stratégie proposée permet aux opérateurs de :-	Prendre en compte les variabilités et incertitudes des paramètres d’intérêt et de quantifier leur impact sur le taux de fuite total ;-	Introduire les défauts relevés au cours d’inspections visuelles dans le calcul ;-	Anticiper et optimiser les actions de mitigation des fuites pour éviter un prolongement d’arrêt de tranche et les pertes d’exploitation associées.},

In order to reduce the numerical cost of such complex computations, the proposed strategy is based on a coarse but adapted mesh together with a chained weakly-coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical modeling. The total leakage rate is then computed with a specially-designed tridimensional finite element based on a non-linear thermal analogy.This methodology is used to model the behavior of the {VeRCoRs} mock-up, a simplified nuclear reactor building at scale 1:3, built and monitored by {EDF}. Results obtained until the first pre-operational pressurization test have been discussed in a dedicated benchmark organized by {EDF}. The proposed methodology provides delayed strains and leakage results in good agreement with available experimental data.

	abstract = {Finite element ({FE}) implementations of nearly incompressible material models often employ decoupled numerical treatments of the dilatational and deviatoric parts of the deformation gradient. This treatment allows the dilatational stiffness to be handled separately to alleviate ill conditioning of the tangent stiffness matrix. However, this can lead to complex formulations of the material tangent moduli that can be difficult to implement or may require custom {FE} codes, thus limiting their general use. Here we present an approach, based on work by Miehe (Miehe, 1996, “Numerical Computation of Algorithmic (Consistent) Tangent Moduli in Large Strain Computational Inelasticity,” Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng., 134, pp. 223–240), for an efficient numerical approximation of the tangent moduli that can be easily implemented within commercial {FE} codes. By perturbing the deformation gradient, the material tangent moduli from the Jaumann rate of the Kirchhoff stress are accurately approximated by a forward difference of the associated Kirchhoff stresses. The merit of this approach is that it produces a concise mathematical formulation that is not dependent on any particular material model. Consequently, once the approximation method is coded in a subroutine, it can be used for other hyperelastic material models with no modification. The implementation and accuracy of this approach is first demonstrated with a simple neo-Hookean material. Subsequently, a fiber-reinforced structural model is applied to analyze the pressure-diameter curve during blood vessel inflation. Implementation of this approach will facilitate the incorporation of novel hyperelastic material models for a soft tissue behavior into commercial {FE} software.},

Finite elements simulations have been performed on realistic polycrystalline aggregate with recently proposed physically-based crystal plasticity constitutive equations validated for neutron-irradiated austenitic stainless steel. Intergranular normal stress probability density functions are found with respect to plastic strain and irradiation level, for uniaxial loading conditions. In addition, plastic slip activity jumps at grain boundaries are also presented. Intergranular normal stress distributions describe, from a statistical point of view, the potential increase of intergranular stress with respect to the macroscopic stress due to grain-grain interactions. The distributions are shown to be well described by a master curve once rescaled by the macroscopic stress, in the range of irradiation level and strain considered in this study. The upper tail of this master curve is shown to be insensitive to free surface effect, which is relevant for {IGSCC} predictions, and also relatively insensitive to small perturbations in crystallographic texture, but sensitive to grain shapes.},

With numerical homogenization the effective properties at the concrete scale are estimated. Numerical homogenization has the advantage of allowing assessing local information and to study more complex geometries. This combined strategy constitutes a promising tool to investigate how different mechanisms leading to ageing at the hydrated products scale, as well as other features of cement-based materials such as the Interfacial Transition Zone ({ITZ}), affect the viscoelastic behaviour at superior scales. In this context, we study the solidification of non-ageing constituents as the mechanisms leading to the ageing behaviour combined or not with a space-filling process in C–S–H.

On décrit ici ce modèle, disponible dans Code\_Aster sous le nom de META\_LEMA\_ANI, et son algorithme de  résolution. Il est disponible en 3D, déformation plane, axisymétrie.

La matrice d’anisotropie de Hill est renseignée dans le repère cylindrique associé au tube. À ce jour, on a  supposé que l’axe axial z du repère cylindrique associé au tube correspondait à celui du repère global. Si bien  que si plusieurs tubes doivent être modélisés ou bien si l’axe du tube ne correspond pas à celui du repère  global, le modèle n’est pas correct. A terme, il faudrait soulever cette restriction. Les équations en vitesse sont intégrées numériquement par un schéma implicite d’Euler. Le système  d’équations obtenu est résolu par la méthode de Newton.},

	abstract = {Parmi les combustibles nucléaires irradiés dans les Réacteurs à Eau Pressurisée d'Électricité de France, on trouve le combustible MOX, acronyme anglais de Mixed Oxide car il combine du dioxyde de plutonium et d'uranium. On y distingue trois phases, correspondant à des teneurs massiques en plutonium différentes. La teneur en matière fissile y étant différente, ces phases évoluent différemment sous irradiation, tant du point de vue mécanique que du point de vue chimique. Pour modéliser correctement le comportement macroscopique du combustible MOX dans un code de calcul industriel, les modèles ont besoin d'être alimentés de façon pertinente en propriétés effectives, mais il est aussi intéressant de disposer d'informations sur les champs locaux afin d'établir des couplages entre les mécanismes (couplage mécanique physico-chimie). L'objectif de la thèse fut donc de développer une modélisation par changement d'échelles, basée sur l'approche NTFA (Michel et Suquet 2003). Ces développements ont été réalisés sur des microstructures tridimensionnelles (3D) représentatives du combustible MOX et pour un comportement local visco-élastique vieillissant avec déformations libres. Dans un premier temps, pour représenter le combustible MOX en 3D nous avons utilisé des méthodes existantes pour traiter et segmenter les images expérimentales 2D, puis nous avons remonté les informations 2D indispensables (fuseau diamétral des inclusions et fractions surfaciques respectives) en 3D par la méthode stéréologique de Saltykov (Saltykov 1967) et enfin nous avons développé des outils pour représenter et discrétiser un composite multiphasé particulaire, type MOX.},

à 25°C, 350°C et 480°C. La résistance mécanique et l’écrouissage du matériau dépendent de la température et des teneurs en hydrogène en solution solide et en hydrures précipités. L’anisotropie plastique du matériau est peu modifiée par l’hydrogène. A température ambiante le matériau est fragilisé par les hydrures, qui rompent pour des déformations plastiques d’autant plus faibles que la teneur en hydrogène est élevée. La ductilité du matériau, croissante en fonction de la température, n’est pas affectée par l’hydrogène à 350°C et 480°C. Les modes de rupture macroscopiques et les mécanismes microscopiques d’endommagement diffèrent selon la géométrie des éprouvettes, la température et la teneur en hydrogène. Un modèle de type Gurson–Tvergaard–Needleman est proposé pour représenter le comportement viscoplastique anisotro pe et la rupture ductile du matériau en fonction de la température et de la teneur en hydrogène.

	abstract = {The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) is used to study, in situ, spatially resolved decomposition in individual nanocrystals of metal hydroxides and oxyhydroxides. This case study reports on the decomposition of indium hydroxide (c-In(OH)3) to bixbyite-type indium oxide (c-In2O3). The electron beam is focused onto a single cube-shaped In(OH)3 crystal of \{100\} morphology with ca. 35 nm edge length and a sequence of HR-TEM images was recorded during electron beam irradiation. The frame-by-frame analysis of video sequences allows for the in situ, time-resolved observation of the shape and orientation of the transformed crystals, which in turn enables the evaluation of the kinetics of c-In2O3 crystallization. Supplementary material (video of the transformation) related to this article can be found online at 10.1016/j.jssc.2012.09.022. After irradiation the shape of the parent cube-shaped crystal is preserved, however, its linear dimension (edge) is reduced by the factor 1.20. The corresponding spotted selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern representing zone [001] of c-In(OH)3 is transformed to a diffuse strongly textured ring-like pattern of c-In2O3 that indicates the transformed cube is no longer a single crystal but is disintegrated into individual c-In2O3 domains with the size of about 5–10 nm. The induction time of approximately 15 s is estimated from the time-resolved Fourier transforms. The volume fraction of the transformed phase (c-In2O3), calculated from the shrinkage of the parent c-In(OH)3 crystal in the recorded HR-TEM images, is used as a measure of the kinetics of c-In2O3 crystallization within the framework of Avrami–Erofeev formalism. The Avrami exponent of ∼3 is characteristic for a reaction mechanism with fast nucleation at the beginning of the reaction and subsequent three-dimensional growth of nuclei with a constant growth rate. The structural transformation path in reconstructive decomposition of c-In(OH)3 to c-In2O3 is discussed in terms of (i) the displacement of hydrogen atoms that lead to breaking the hydrogen bond between OH groups of [In(OH)6] octahedra and finally to their destabilization and (ii) transformation of the vertices-shared indium–oxygen octahedra in c-In(OH)3 to vertices- and edge-shared octahedra in c-In2O3.},

The “return mapping” (Simo and Hughes, 1998) and the “bipotential” (de Saxcé, 1992) are one of those, associated respectively to two different classes of materials: the General Standard Materials (GSM) for the return mapping and the Implicit Standard Materials (ISM) for the bipotential.

The objective of this paper is then to compare the implementation of those both methods in the case of non associated flow rules in plasticity.

In the first section, the properties of the different previous material classes will be recalled and the methods of “return mapping” and “bipotential” will be detailed. The comparison of both methods is realised on the non linear kinematic hardening rule of Armstrong–Frederick (Armstrong and Frederick, 1966) in a second section and the details are given in a third part. The numerical implementation is realised in Abaqus/Standard 6.11 by the means of a UMat subroutine and the practical simple case of tension–compression is analysed in a last section.},

	abstract = {This study is devoted to the mechanical behavior of uranium dioxide (UO2) which is a porous material with two populations of voids of very different size subjected to internal pressure. The smallest voids are intragranular and spherical in shape whereas the largest pores located at the grain boundary are ellipsoidal and randomly oriented. In this first part of the study, attention is focused on the effective properties of these materials with fixed microstructure. In a first step, the poro-elastic properties of these doubly voided materials are studied. Then two rigorous upper bounds are derived for the effective poro-plastic constitutive relations of these materials. The first bound, obtained by generalizing the approach of Gologanu et al. (Gologanu, M., Leblond, J., Devaux, J., 1994. Approximate models for ductile metals containing non-spherical voids-case of axisymmetric oblate ellipsoidal cavities. ASME J. Eng. Mater. Technol. 116, 290–297) to compressible materials, is accurate at high stress-triaxiality. The second one, which derives from the variational method of Ponte Castañeda (Ponte Castañeda, P., 1991. The effective mechanical properties of non-linear isotropic composites. J. Mech. Phys. Solids 39, 45–71), is accurate when the stress triaxiality is low. A N-phase model, inspired by Bilger et al. (Bilger, N., Auslender, F., Bornert, M., Masson, R., 2002. New bounds and estimates for porous media with rigid perfectly plastic matrix. C.R. Mécanique 330, 127–132), is proposed which matches the best of the two bounds at low and high triaxiality. The effect of internal pressures is discussed. In particular it is shown that when the two internal pressures coincide, the effective flow surface of the saturated biporous material is obtained from that of the drained material by a shift along the hydrostatic axis. However, when the two pressures are different, the modifications brought to the effective flow surface in the drained case involve not only a shift along the hydrostatic axis but also a change in shape and size of the surface.},

The vented pin design, with porous plug and sodium bonding which allows the choice of large diameters, has been taken, since the Rapsodie experience was decisive. The absorber material is sintered, 10B enriched, boron carbide. The can is made of 316 type stainless steel, stabilised, or not, with titanium. The experience gained in Phenix up to now is important, and deals with about six loads of control rods. Results confirm the validity of the design of the absorber pins. Some difficulties have been encountered for the guiding devices, due to the swelling of the steel. They have required design and material improvements. Such difficulties are discarded by a new design of the bearing, for the Super-Phenix control rods. The other parts of these rods, from the Primary Shut-Down System, are strictly derived from Phenix. The design of the rods from the Secondary Shut-Down System is rather different, but it's not the case for the design of the absorber pins: in many ways, they are derived from Phenix pins and from Rapsodie control rods. Both types of rod irradiation tests are in progress in Phenix.},

	title = {Recent modelling improvements in fuel performance code {GERMINAL} for {SFR} oxide fuel pins},
	abstract = {To support the design studies of ASTRID, the future technological Sodium Fast Reactor demonstrator in France,
the modelling of mixed oxide fuel pins has been improved by developing a new version of GERMINAL fuel
performance code within PLEIADES simulation framework. GERMINAL V2 is using a standard « 1D1⁄2 »
representation of the fuel pin. Thermal analysis and mechanics are now based on finite elements computations.
The fuel pellet is considered as a continuum, with a mechanical behaviour model managing element elimination
during the central hole formation. The expansion due to cracking during heat-up, and later the free volumes
closure between the fragments, are described by two imposed strain terms. By solving the fuel / cladding system
equilibrium, we intend to evaluate the mechanical interaction, which can become significant, and the stresses
induced by swelling gradients in the cladding thickness. Off-normal conditions are simulated by a strong
coupling of thermal-hydraulics in the coolant with the thermal analysis of the fuel pin. A new neutronics scheme
has also been developed, integrating progressively the evolutions of volatile fission products. Their release at
high burn-up causes the “Joint Oxyde-Gaine” formation between pellet and cladding. With a refined prediction
of the JOG composition, we intend to improve the evaluation of heat exchange inside gap at high burn-up, and
also the description of cladding corrosion. Helium production has already been completed, to simulate fuel pins
loaded with minor actinides. All these evolutions implemented in GERMINAL V2 are being validated by
simulating fuel elements irradiated in PHENIX or in CABRI reactor. We are considering objects from different
geometries, with various cladding materials, burn-ups and irradiation histories. The comparisons of the
calculation results with the experimental data show the current abilities and limits of the code, and consequently
the working perspectives we have.},

	abstract = {Elevated temperature has significant effect on the mechanical response of metals and alloys. Industrial processes often use high temperature forming to fabricate components of complex shape from alloys such as aluminum or magnesium that have low room temperature formability. Accurate forming models to integrate warm forming in computer aided engineering (CAE) in production environment has been hampered by a lack of constitutive relations at elevated temperatures, forcing one to rely on experimental data for such integration. In this paper, a new thermo elasto-viscoplastic (TEV) constitutive relation is developed to model the behavior of face-centred cubic (FCC) polycrystals, especially aluminum alloys, at elevated temperatures. The model takes into account the temperature dependence of the single crystal elastic coefficients, single slip hardening parameters, thermal softening, rate sensitivity, and the total deformation. The TEV framework has been implemented into the commercial finite element code LS-DYNA to study the effects of temperature on metal forming. Uniaxial tension simulations at six different temperatures ranging from 25 °C to 260 °C have been performed and calibrated with published experimental results. Equations for the variation of single-slip hardening parameters with temperature have been developed for the AA5754 aluminum alloy. Shear test simulations at different temperatures have been used to validate the model. The proposed framework for the single slip parameters for uniaxial tension accurately predicts the shear stress-shear strain data without the need for any further fitting parameter. Temperature dependence of texture evolution, single slip hardening and hardening rates, thermal softening, and slip activity in AA5754 sheet alloy during temperatures corresponding to warm forming temperatures are investigated.},

	abstract = {The paper outlines a constitutive model for finite thermo-visco-plastic behavior of amorphous glassy polymers and considers details of its numerical implementation. In contrast to existing kinematical approaches to finite plasticity of glassy polymers, the formulation applies a plastic metric theory based on an additive split of Lagrangian Hencky-type strains into elastic and plastic parts. The analogy between the proposed formulation in the logarithmic strain space and the geometrically linear theory of plasticity, makes this constitutive framework very transparent and attractive with regard to its numerical formulation. The characteristic strain hardening of the model is derived from a polymer network model. We consider the particularly simple eight chain model, but also comment on the recently developed microsphere model. The viscoplastic flow rule in the logarithmic strain space uses structures of the free volume flow theory, which provides a highly predictive modeling capacity at the onset of viscoplastic flow. The integration of this micromechanically motivated approach into a three-dimensional computational model is a key concern of this work. We outline details of the numerical implementation of this model, including elements such as geometric pre- and post-transformations to/from the logarithmic strain space, a thermomechanical operator split algorithm consisting of an isothermal mechanical predictor followed by a heat conduction corrector and finally, the consistent linearization of the local update algorithm for the dissipative variables as well as its relationship to the global tangent operator. The performance of the proposed formulation is demonstrated by means of a spectrum of numerical examples, which we compare with our experimental findings.},

	abstract = {The thermodynamical framework of an elastoplastic model coupled to anisotropic damage is presented in this paper. In the finite strain context, the proposed model is based on the multiplicative decomposition of the strain gradient into elastic and plastic parts. The anisotropic degradation is introduced by means of a second order tensor and another intermediate configuration is introduced by fictitiously removing this degradation from the plastic intermediate configuration. To enhance the physical meaning of the Mandel-like stress measure work conjugated to the inelastic flow stated in this fictitious configuration, i.e. the “effective stress”, a new damage rate tensor is defined with its associated push-forward and pull-back operations. The emphasis in this paper is placed on the description of the interesting properties of the novel definitions of the push-forward and pull-back operations which are discussed through a thermodynamical framework. Furthermore, a specific constitutive model with the plastic and damage flow rules deduced from the restrictions imposed by the second law of thermodynamics is discussed with an application on an asphalt concrete material where the anisotropic evolution of the damage is highlighted.},

The micromechanical model is based on an extension of the NTFA method proposed by Michel and Suquet (2003, 2004). The local plastic strain field is divided into a volumetric part and a deviatoric part. Each part is expressed as a linear combination of relevant non-uniform plastic strain fields, called “plastic modes”. The non-uniform microscopic strain fields are thus described by a finite number of reduced internal variables. And the local constitutive models are then reformulated in terms of such variables. The proposed model is applied to two typical heterogeneous materials: inclusion reinforced composite and porous material. Numerical results obtained by the NTFA are compared with the direct finite element solutions. In particular, the macroscopic yield stresses of porous materials are compared between the NTFA and some recently proposed analytical criteria. Finally, as an application example, the micromechanical model is used to simulate laboratory tests performed on porous sandstone.},

	abstract = {To support the design studies of ASTRID, the future technological Sodium Fast Reactor demonstrator in France,
the modelling of mixed oxide fuel pins has been improved by developing a new version of GERMINAL fuel
performance code within PLEIADES simulation framework. GERMINAL V2 is using a standard « 1D1⁄2 »
representation of the fuel pin. Thermal analysis and mechanics are now based on finite elements computations.
The fuel pellet is considered as a continuum, with a mechanical behaviour model managing element elimination
during the central hole formation. The expansion due to cracking during heat-up, and later the free volumes
closure between the fragments, are described by two imposed strain terms. By solving the fuel / cladding system
equilibrium, we intend to evaluate the mechanical interaction, which can become significant, and the stresses
induced by swelling gradients in the cladding thickness. Off-normal conditions are simulated by a strong
coupling of thermal-hydraulics in the coolant with the thermal analysis of the fuel pin. A new neutronics scheme
has also been developed, integrating progressively the evolutions of volatile fission products. Their release at
high burn-up causes the “Joint Oxyde-Gaine” formation between pellet and cladding. With a refined prediction
of the JOG composition, we intend to improve the evaluation of heat exchange inside gap at high burn-up, and
also the description of cladding corrosion. Helium production has already been completed, to simulate fuel pins
loaded with minor actinides. All these evolutions implemented in GERMINAL V2 are being validated by
simulating fuel elements irradiated in PHENIX or in CABRI reactor. We are considering objects from different
geometries, with various cladding materials, burn-ups and irradiation histories. The comparisons of the
calculation results with the experimental data show the current abilities and limits of the code, and consequently
the working perspectives we have.},

Within the framework of closest-point-projection algorithms, a methodology is presented whereby tangent operators consistent with this class of algorithms may be systematically developed. To wit, associative J2 flow rules with general nonlinear kinematic and isotropic hardening rules, as well as a class of non-associative flow rules are considered. The resulting iterative solution scheme preserves the asymptotic quadratic convergence characteristic of Newton's method, whereas use of the socalled elastoplastic tangent in conjunction with a radial return integration algorithm, a procedure often employed, results in Newton type of algorithms with suboptimal rate of convergence. Application is made to a set of numerical examples which include saturation hardening laws of exponential type.},

In this paper, we focus on the mechanical behavior of uranium dioxide. These pellets exhibit a yield point during strain hardening tests and sigmoı̈dal creep curves, that is inflection points characteristic of a non-monotonous viscoplastic flow in the first stages of the tests. Inspired by Alexander and Haasen’s work upon single crystal silicon, we develop a dislocation-based model that is able to describe the viscoplasticity of uranium dioxide in the range of temperature and stress of the PCMI. After developing this model, we introduce it into the Pilvin’s polycrystalline approach. The self-consistency of the polycrystalline approach in the case of a non-monotonous viscoplastic flow is demonstrated in an independent article.},

The first one is concerned with the estimation of the opening of a radial crack in a pellet fragment induced by the radial thermal gradient in the pellet and limited by the pellet-clad contact pressure. The second one describes the stress distribution in a cladding bore in front of an opening pellet crack. A linear angular variation of the pellet-clad contact pressure and a constant prescribed radial displacement are considered. The closed-form solutions are checked by comparison to independent finite element models of the pellet fragment and of the cladding. Their ability to describe non-axisymmetric displacement and stress fields during loading histories representative of base irradiation and power ramps is then demonstrated by cross-comparison with the 2D pellet fragment-cladding model of the multi-dimensional fuel performance code ALCYONE. The calculated radial crack opening profiles at different times and the hoop stress concentration in the cladding at the top of the ramp are found in good agreement with ALCYONE.},

	abstract = {For large void volume fraction, the Rousselier porous plasticity model transforms naturally into a coalescence model, in the whole range of stress triaxiality, in agreement with the necessary kinematic coalescence condition (NKCC). It enables to model slant fracture in notched tensile or cracked specimens. Nevertheless, void coalescence is not the single mechanism involved in slant fracture. That is why it is necessary to combine porous plasticity with other models. In this paper, the Coulomb fracture model and the Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) model (or dynamic strain aging: DSA) are formulated at the slip system scale. The Coulomb model combines the resolved normal and shear stresses for each slip plane and direction. For DSA, we postulate that each slip system has its own history of dislocation pinning and unpinning by solute atoms. The models are fully coupled in the framework of classical polycrystalline plasticity. A Reduced Texture Methodology (RTM) is used to provide the computational efficiency needed for numerical applications. The RTM approach involves a significant reduction of the number of representative crystallographic orientations. The models are applied to a notched tensile specimen taken from a 6260 aluminum alloy thin-walled extrusion. Fractographic examinations show a combination of dimples and large smooth areas on the slant fracture surface (mixed fracture). It highlights the need for combined fracture models. The PLC model gives very sharp oscillations of the macroscopic plastic strain rate, associated with moving plastic strain rate bands. It leads to a significant reduction of ductility compared to porous plasticity alone.},

The algorithm is first built for three-dimensional stress states in a general manner using the return mapping procedure and the Newton–Raphson method. The plane stress constraint is then incorporated into the Newton–Raphson iteration loop derived for three-dimensional stress states. The resulting algorithm has a mode patch that makes the algorithm applicable to both plane stress and three-dimensional stress states. The algorithm is specified by assuming an advanced evolution model of multiple back stresses, and is verified by performing numerical tests using plane stress, shell, and brick elements. The numerical tests are finite element analyses of homogeneously deformed plates and a cyclically loaded single-hole plate. It is demonstrated that the developed algorithm provides the quadratic convergence of iterations for implicit stress integration in plane stress, shell, and brick elements. It is also demonstrated that the algorithm is stable even in large incremental steps.},

	abstract = {The exact formulae for the plastic and the elastic spin referred to the deformed configuration are derived, where the plastic spin is a function of the plastic strain rate and the elastic spin a function of the elastic strain rate. With these exact formulae we determine the macroscopic substructure spin that allows us to define the appropriate corotational rate for finite elastoplasticity.

Plastic, elastic and substructure spin are considered and simplified for various sub-classes of restricted elastic-plastic strains. It is shown that for the special cases of rigid-plasticity and hypoelasticity the proposed corotational rate is identical with the Green-Naghdi rate, while the ZarembaJaumann rate yields a good approximation for moderately large strains.

To compare our exact plastic spin formula with the constitutive assumption for the plastic spin introduced by Dafalias and others, we simplify our result for small elastic-moderate plastic strains and introduce a simplest evolution law for kinematic hardening leading to the Dafalias formula and to an exact determination of its unknown coefficient. It is also shown that contrary to statements in the literature the plastic spin is not zero for vanishing kinematic hardening.

For isotropic-elastic material with induced plastic flow undergoing isotropic and kinematic hardening constitutive and evolution laws are proposed. Elastic and plastic Lagrangean and Eulerian logarithmic strain measures are introduced and their material time derivatives and corotational rates, respectively, are considered. Finally, the elastic-plastic tangent operator is derived.

The presented theory is implemented in a solution algorithm and numerically applied to the simple shear problem for finite elastic-finite plastic strains as well as for sub-classes of restricted strains. The results are compared with those of the literature and with those obtained by using other corotational rates.},

Such a framework is not only well-suited to the mathematical study of the boundary value problem, but also leads in a natural way to an efficient numerical algorithm. The formulation is first presented, then applied to several classes of models existing in the literature : a homogenization-based constitutive relation, a porosity model and gradient plasticity.

	abstract = {A Eulerian rate formulation of finite elastoplasticity is a composite one composed of a rate equation for elastic behaviour and a flow rule for plastic behaviour as well as an evolution equation for hardening behaviour, in which objective Eulerian tensor rates are used. Among a large variety of objective rates (actually infinitely many), how to choose suitable ones has been one of the crucial points in finite elastoplasticity. It is realized that the foregoing composite formulation of elastoplasticity should fulfil certain consistency criteria in order to avoid inconsistencies or contradictions. These criteria narrow the choice of objective rates. These authors (Bruhns and co–workers and Xiao and co–workers) have recently introduced the self–consistency criterion: in a composite formulation of elastoplasticity, the rate equation intended for characterization of elastic behaviour should be exactly integrable to deliver an elastic relation. It has been demonstrated in the work of the aforementioned authors that if a composite formulation of elastoplasticity with objective rates is required to fulfil the just–stated self–consistency criterion, as it should be, then the newly discovered logarithmic rate is the only possible choice among all objective corotational rates, including the Zaremba–Jaumann rate and the Green–Naghdi rate, etc. In the afore–mentioned result, non–corotational rates, including Oldroyd rates, Cotter–Rivlin rate and Truesdell rate, etc., are not taken into consideration in general. It is the main goal of this paper to further establish the uniqueness of the logarithmic rate among all corotational and non–corotational objective rates. Essential to the attainment of this goal is the use of the yielding–stationarity criterion: the vanishing of the stress rate implies that the yield function is stationary. It is shown that the just–stated criterion is necessary for a composite Eulerian rate formulation of finite elastoplasticity to be consistent and means that the stress rate must be a corotational rate. The main goal of this article is, thus, attained by combining the just–stated result and the established result stated before.},

	abstract = {The AMP (Advanced MultiPhysics) Nuclear Fuel Performance code is a new, three-dimensional, multi-physics tool that uses state-of-the-art solution methods and validated nuclear fuel models to simulate the nominal operation and anticipated operational transients of nuclear fuel. The AMP Nuclear Fuel Performance code leverages existing validated material models from traditional fuel performance codes and the Scale/ORIGEN-S spent-fuel characterization code to provide an initial capability that is shown to be sufficiently accurate for a single benchmark problem and anticipated to be accurate for a broad range of problems. The thermomechanics foundation can be solved in a time-dependent or quasi-static approach with any variation of operator-split or fully-coupled solutions at each time step through interoperable interfaces to leading computational mathematics tools, including PETSc, Trilinos, and SUNDIALS. A baseline validation of the AMP Nuclear Fuel Performance code has been performed through the modeling of an experiment in the Halden Reactor Project (IFA-432) that demonstrates the integrated capability and provides a baseline of the initial accuracy of the software.},

	abstract = {A model reproducing strain softening behavior in ceramic materials is proposed. This model is base on a critical treatment of previous mechanical experimental results, mainly on uranium dioxide. The main hypothesis is that the strain softening phenomenon is related to an aging process, where some point defects move towards the dislocations and modify their velocity. This is different from most of models used up to now, as they were based on the hypothesis that only the initial lack of dislocations was responsible of the strain softening behavior. A model is first developed in a simple 1D framework. Evolution of the mechanical behavior with strain rate and temperature is well reproduced by this model. Then, the 1D model is extended to a 3D mechanical model, and mechanical compressive tests on UO 2 pellets are simulated. The 3D model well reproduces the observed asymmetrical shape of the compressed pellet if one considers that the material is not initially perfectly homogeneous, which highlights the importance of accounting for spatial heterogeneity of materials in models.},

	abstract = {We develop in this study a viscodamage model for cementitious materials based on the concept of pseudo-strains introduced by Schapery [1] coupled with the damage model of Mazars [2]. The pseudo-strains approach allows for reformulation of the initial viscoelastic problem as an equivalent elastic one by using a simple correspondence principle. The viscoelastic model results from a homogenization procedure in which the Mori–Tanaka scheme is applied in the Laplace–Carson space for estimating the effective linear viscoelastic bulk and shear moduli of the material. A composite made of a linear viscoelastic matrix described by a generalized Maxwell model and containing distributed spherical elastic inclusions and pores is adopted as a simplified representation of the material under consideration. One interesting feature of our approach is that exact analytical expressions for both bulk and shear moduli in the time space are derived in simple cases where a limited number of Maxwell chains are involved to describe the matrix behavior. The evolutions of the damage variable are governed by an equivalent pseudo-strain calculated from the pseudo-strains. The viscodamage model is applied to the simulation of cement paste basic creep tests available in the literature. After a proper identification of the parameters, an analysis of the results obtained with moderate creep loading reveals that the total strains evolutions are due mainly to the viscous characteristics of the material and to a lesser extent to the damage growth. The effects of the pore volume fraction of the material and of high load-levels leading to the specimen rupture on the creep response are further investigated and discussed.},

The possible generalisation of Fenchel's inequality proposed by de Saxcé allows the recovery of flow rule normality for non-associative behaviours. The normality rule is written in the weak form of an implicit relation. This leads to the introduction of the class of implicit standard materials. This formulation is applied to constitutive equations involving non-linear kinematic hardening, indispensable to describe accurately and realistically the cyclic plasticity of metallic materials. For these plastic flow rules shakedown bound theorems can be extended; an analytical example of the shakedown of a thin-walled tube under constant traction and alternate cyclic torsion is considered and the obtained solution is proved to be exact.},

First, the kinematics of large strain based on multiplicative decomposition of the total transformation gradient using the rotating frame formulation, is recalled and different objective derivatives defined. By using different anisotropic equivalent stresses (quadratic and non-quadratic) in yield function and in plastic potential, the evolution equations for all the dissipative phenomena are deduced from the generalized normality rule applied to the plastic potential while the consistency condition is still applied to the yield function. The effect of the objective derivatives and the equivalent stresses (quadratic or non-quadratic) on the plastic flow anisotropy and the hardening evolution with damage is considered. Numerical aspects mainly related to the time integration of the fully coupled constitutive equations are discussed. Applications are made to the AISI 304 sheet metal by considering different loading paths as tensile, shear, plane tensile and bulge tests. For each loading path the effect of the rotating frame, the equivalent stress (quadratic or non-quadratic) and the normality rule (with respect to yield function or to the plastic potential) are discussed on the light of some available experimental results.},

	abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to formulate a very new statically-based model of ductile porous materials having a von Mises matrix. In contrast to the Gurson’s well known kinematical approach applied to a hollow sphere, the proposed study proceeds by means of a statical limit analysis procedure. Its development and implementation require the choice of an appropriate trial stress field. The starting point is Hill’s variational principle for rigid plastic matrix. The use of a lagrangian multiplier allows to satisfy the plastic criterion in an average sense. The proposed trial stress field, complying with internal equilibrium, is composed of an heterogeneous part (exact solution for the stress field in the hollow sphere under pure hydrostatic loading) to which is added a uniform deviatoric stress field. Owing to this choice, the stress vector conditions on the void boundary are relaxed. By solving the resulting Saddle point problem, we derive closed form formula which depends not only on the first and second invariant of the macroscopic stress tensor but also on the sign of the third invariant of the stress deviator. The obtained results are fully discussed and compared to existing models, available numerical data and to Finite Elements results obtained from cell calculation carried out during the present study. Finally, we provide for the new model the macroscopic flow rule as well as the porosity evolution equations which also show very original features. Some of these features are illustrated.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this work is the formulation of models for the dynamics of continua with microstructure and material inhomogeneity. In particular, attention is focused here on the balance relations and configurational fields for such continua obtained via invariance. To this end, the approach of Capriz (Capriz, G., 1989. Springer Tracts in Natural Philosophy, vol. 37) to the formulation of continua with microstructure as based upon the invariance of the internal power with respect to superimposed rigid-body rotations is extended to one based upon the Euclidean frame-indifference of the total energy balance. This is then combined with an extension of the work of Gurtin (Gurtin, M.E., 1995. Arch. Rat. Mech. Anal. 131, 67–100) on the formulation of static configurational fields to the case of dynamic and microstructure. In this way, one obtains in particular the dependence of the configurational momentum density, configurational or Eshelby stress, as well as the internal and external configurational momentum supply rate, or configurational force, densities, on the corresponding microstructural fields. These can then be used to derive the forms of the balance relations relevant to the case that the continuum contains defects at which the microstructure is discontinuous. As an application of the formulation, this is done here for the case of a continuum with microstructure containing a single defect.},

It focusses on the derivatives of symmetric second-order isotropic tensor functions by a symmetric second-order tensor argument. This tensor argument is assumed to be given in spectral form. The first representation explicitly needs the eigenvectors of the argument tensor and is well-known in the literature. The second representation proposed here is based on the knowledge of second-order eigenvalue bases and avoids the computation of eigenvectors. The evaluation of a typical model problem shows that the second representation needs less computer time than the first one. The representations discussed here are of high importance for numerical solvers of nonlinear initial-boundary-value problems in large-strain elasticity and elastoplasticity.},

Recent interest in the research and development of this type of methods has arisen from their capability to overcome theoretical limits of one-point methods concerning the convergence order and computational efficiency. This survey paper is a mixture of theoretical results and algorithmic aspects and it is intended as a review of the most efficient root-finding algorithms and developing techniques in a general sense. Many existing methods of great efficiency appear as special cases of presented general iterative schemes. Special attention is devoted to multipoint methods with memory that use already computed information to considerably increase convergence rate without additional computational costs. Some classical results of the 1970s which have had a great influence to the topic, often neglected or unknown to many readers, are also included not only as historical notes but also as genuine sources of many recent ideas. To a certain degree, the presented study follows in parallel main themes shown in the recently published book (Petković et al., 2013) [53], written by the authors of this paper.},

The reported experimental data concerns stainless steels and have been published previously.

Four other theories are then presented and compared in a systematic way. They include the Ohno-Kachi time-independent plasticity theory, two unified viscoplastic models by Walker and by Krempl and Yao, the new developments of the endochronic theory by Watanabe and Atluri.

The nonlinear kinematic hardening rule is extended from that developed by Abdel-Karim and Ohno (2000) for infinitesimal plasticity. The cyclic hardening/softening feature of materials is reflected by using a nonlinear isotropic hardening rule. Then, the proposed model is implemented into a finite element code (e.g., ABAQUS) by employing a simple fully-implicit time-integration procedure. Finally, some numerical examples are carried out to verify the capability of the model to predict the cyclic deformation of materials in finite deformation by comparing the predictions with the corresponding experiment results in referable literature. The predicted stress responses during a simple shear with large shear strain and ratchetting during the cyclic loading tests in finite deformation are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental results.},

	abstract = {The mechanical test procedures that address fuel cladding failure during a RIA are reviewed with an emphasis on the development of test procedures that determine the deformation and fracture behavior of cladding under conditions similar to those reached in a RIA. An analysis of cladding strain data from experimental research reactor test programs that have simulated the RIA is presented. These data show that the cladding undergoes deformation characterized by hoop extension subject to a range of multiaxial stress states and strain paths comprised between plane-strain (no axial extension of the cladding tube) and equal-biaxial tension (equal strain in both the hoop and the axial orientations). Current mechanical test procedures of cladding material are then reviewed with a focus on their ability to generate the appropriate deformation response and to induce the prototypical multiaxial stress states and failure modes activated during a RIA. Two main groups of tests currently exist. In the first group, the deformation behavior of the cladding is examined by several variations of hoop tensile tests in which an axial contraction of the specimen gage section occurs such that a near-uniaxial tension stress state results; finite element analyses are then usually employed to deduce the deformation response, often under conditions of an assumed coefficient of friction between the specimen and test fixtures. The second group includes test procedures which attempt to reproduce the deformation and failure conditions close to those seen during a RIA such that any stress-state corrections of the failure conditions are comparatively small. The advantages and disadvantages of all of these deformation/fracture tests are discussed with special reference to testing high burnup fuel cladding.},

	abstract = {A new continuum damage mechanics model is developed to describe the behaviour of quasi-brittle materials under general path loading. The induced damage is represented by a second rank symmetric tensor. The constitutive equations are based on irreversible thermodynamics theory. The strain-based model covers in an unified way the unsymmetrical behaviour in tension and in compression and the unilateral response due to crack closure effect. Uniaxial stress tests (in tension as in compression) show realistic non-linear responses in the stress–strain space. The different behaviour in both domains is covered by a single set of equations. A significant volume dilatation is noticed in compression. The model can be generalised to time-dependent phenomena.},

	abstract = {Austenitic stainless steels used as fuel cladding or structural components in various reactor types must often withstand an exceptionally strenuous and challenging environment, even in the absence of neutron irradiation. In addition to the environmental challenges associated with surviving prolonged exposure to high temperature and corrosive media, exposure to displacive neutron irradiation pushes steels into a progressive nonequilibrium evolution involving generation of completely new microstructural components unique to the radiation environment and new phase structures driven by diffusional processes that operate only during irradiation. The result of such microstructural and microchemical alteration is often the production of an alloy that cannot be found on an equilibrium diagram.

Concurrent with this evolution on the microscopic scale are macroscopic changes in physical and mechanical properties, and most importantly, changes in dimensional stability that are outside the realm of normal engineering experience. Such changes can strongly affect the structural integrity and limit the in-reactor lifetime of structural steels.

While reviews of this type usually focus primarily on the displacive aspects of neutron irradiation and perhaps confine the review to one or two types of reactor, it is necessary in this review to give equal attention to the transmutation aspects of irradiation for the full range of neutron flux-spectral environments. This review first focuses on identifying the important characteristics of various reactor environments, then addresses the microscopic aspects of neutron-induced alteration, and finally moves to cover the macroscopic consequences of these alterations.},

The level of complexity of the constitutive equations and the degree of coupling through damage is high and it is difficult to calibrate values of the constitutive constants without recourse to optimisation techniques. A methodology for the analysis of uni-axial experimental data, coupled with a traditional gradient-based optimisation technique, is presented for the unique determination of the constitutive constants. Two sets of experimental data on parent material are used for inversion purposes: at 565 °C, c.f. Cane [Cane BJ.

	abstract = {The description of anisotropic elastic–plastic behaviour at large strain is difficult. In the rigid plastic case, anisotropic plasticity is now reasonably well understood and is based on formulating anisotropic constitutive equations in a moving frame which, correctly chosen, will ensure objectivity and which can be postulated: (i) a priori to follow in some sense the material rotations (kinematical rotating frame); (ii) a posteriori by an appropriate constitutive evolution equation (plastic spin equation). With respect to the classical continuum models this is in fact an alternative for the formulation of frame indifferent constitutive equations. This rotating frame formulation of continuum mechanics is first formally presented and applied to anisotropic elasticity to show that in this case the proper rotating frame must be used to get a true elasticity. The remaining part of the paper is then devoted to the elastic–plastic case starting from a direct extension of the formalism with derivation of the elastic constitutive equation and plastic flow rule which is best written in the so-called isoclinic configuration. Finally the kinematic plastic rotating frames will be introduced and exemplified as the appropriate choice for a correct description of an anisotropic elastic–plastic behaviour.},

The TRANSURANUS code consists of a clearly defined mechanical-mathematical framework into which physical models can easily be incorporated. Besides its flexibility for different fuel rod designs the TRANSURANUS code can deal with very different situations, as given for instance in an experiment, under normal, off-normal and accident conditions. The time scale of the problems to be treated may range from milliseconds to years. The code has a comprehensive material data bank for oxide, mixed oxide, carbide and nitride fuels, Zircaloy and steel claddings and different coolants. During its development great effort was spent on obtaining an extremely flexible tool which is easy to handle, exhibiting very fast running times. The total development effort is approximately 40 man-years. In recent years the interest to use this code grew and the code is in use in several organisations, both research and private industry. The code is now available to all interested parties.

The paper outlines the main features and capabilities of the TRANSURANUS code, its validation and treats also some practical aspects.},

Revisiting brittle fracture as an energy minimization problem. J. Mech. Phys. Solids 46 (8), 1319–1342]. We focus on the linear elastic case where the contact condition appears as a local unilateral constraint on the displacement jump at the crack surfaces. The regularized model is obtained by splitting the strain energy in a spherical and a deviatoric parts and accounting for the sign of the local volume change. The numerical implementation is based on a standard finite element discretization and on the adaptation of an alternate minimization algorithm used in previous works. The new regularization avoids crack interpenetration and predicts asymmetric results in traction and in compression. Even though we do not exhibit any gamma-convergence proof toward the desired limit behavior, we illustrate through several numerical case studies the pertinence of the new model in comparison to other approaches.},

Changes in strength, ductility and fracture toughness are strongly related to the evolution of the damage microstructure and microstructurally-based models for strengthening reasonably correlate the data. Irradiation-induced defects promote work softening and flow localization which in turn leads to significant reductions in ductility and fracture toughness beyond about 10 dpa. The effects of irradiation on fatigue appear to be modest except at high temperature where helium embrittlement becomes important. The swelling-independent component of irradiation creep strain increases linearly with dose and is relatively insensitive to material variables and irradiation temperature, except at low temperatures where accelerated creep may occur as a result of low vacancy mobility. Creep rupture life is a strong function of helium content, but is less sensitive to metallurgical conditions. Irradiation-induced stress corrosion cracking appears to be related to the evolution of radiation-induced segregation/depletion at grain boundaries, and hence may not be significant at low irradiation temperatures.},

	abstract = {This study is concerned with structural integrity assessment of Pressure Water Reactor's (PWR) fuel rods under pellet–cladding interaction (PCI) loading condition. An important experimental and research cooperative program between EDF, AREVA-NP and the Atomic Energy Commission CEA is achieved in order to get a better understanding of the mechanisms possibly leading to PCI failure, as well as to qualify a PCI resistant rod design. The objectives of this work are: first, to improve the understanding of the pellet mechanical properties impact on cladding local loading with 3D simulations results, and second, to propose a new phenomenological rupture criterion for a better assessment of the failure risk.

In this study fuel behaviour modelling under nominal and transient loading conditions is achieved with a multi-dimensional simulation tool called ALCYONE, included in the new fuel software PLEIADES currently co-developed by the CEA and EDF. Cladding loading due to mechanical interaction during power transient stage is first analysed through pellet–cladding interfacial stresses computed in the 3D simulation. Then, a 2D model is proposed in order to establish a correlation between interfacial loading and stress concentration in the cladding. In order to assess the failure risk under PCI a phenomenological criterion based on the membrane circumferential stress in the cladding and shear stresses at pellet–cladding interface is proposed. To compute the shear loading at pellet–cladding interface a new parameter (called Wrθ) is introduced. Based on 3D calculations of PCI, it is shown in this paper that pellet fracture properties can have a significant effect on PCI loading.},

Several successful techniques for handling such problems are based on quasi-Newton methods that implicitly update the approximate Jacobian or inverse Jacobian to satisfy a certain secant condition. We present two classes of multisecant methods which allow to take into account a variable number of secant equations at each iteration. The first is the Broyden-like class, of which Broyden's family is a subclass, and Anderson mixing is a particular member. The second class is that of the nonlinear Eirola–Nevanlinna-type methods. This work was motivated by a problem in electronic structure calculations, whereby a fixed point iteration, known as the self-consistent field (SCF) iteration, is accelerated by various strategies termed ‘mixing’.

	abstract = {To support the design studies of ASTRID, the future technological Sodium Fast Reactor demonstrator in France,
the modelling of mixed oxide fuel pins has been improved by developing a new version of GERMINAL fuel
performance code within PLEIADES simulation framework. GERMINAL V2 is using a standard « 1D1⁄2 »
representation of the fuel pin. Thermal analysis and mechanics are now based on finite elements computations.
The fuel pellet is considered as a continuum, with a mechanical behaviour model managing element elimination
during the central hole formation. The expansion due to cracking during heat-up, and later the free volumes
closure between the fragments, are described by two imposed strain terms. By solving the fuel / cladding system
equilibrium, we intend to evaluate the mechanical interaction, which can become significant, and the stresses
induced by swelling gradients in the cladding thickness. Off-normal conditions are simulated by a strong
coupling of thermal-hydraulics in the coolant with the thermal analysis of the fuel pin. A new neutronics scheme
has also been developed, integrating progressively the evolutions of volatile fission products. Their release at
high burn-up causes the “Joint Oxyde-Gaine” formation between pellet and cladding. With a refined prediction
of the JOG composition, we intend to improve the evaluation of heat exchange inside gap at high burn-up, and
also the description of cladding corrosion. Helium production has already been completed, to simulate fuel pins
loaded with minor actinides. All these evolutions implemented in GERMINAL V2 are being validated by
simulating fuel elements irradiated in PHENIX or in CABRI reactor. We are considering objects from different
geometries, with various cladding materials, burn-ups and irradiation histories. The comparisons of the
calculation results with the experimental data show the current abilities and limits of the code, and consequently
the working perspectives we have.},

	abstract = {A stable stress integration algorithm of the elastoplastic constitutive equations for materials under a plane stress condition has been developed. In the algorithm, the trial stress obtained by elastic prediction is geometrically relaxed to the closest point on the yield surface in the principal stress plane. The direction of return-mapping is first obtained through the minimization problem using the Newton-Raphson method, and thereafter the plastic parameter is determined. As a model of yield criterion, Hill's quadratic normal anisotropic yield function has been adopted. The accuracy of the algorithm has been shown by iso-error maps for several materials. It has been revealed that errors are within 5\% when the explicit time-integration method is adopted. In order to show the applicability of the algorithm, two kinds of sheet metal forming processes being able to represent various states of stress on the yield surface have been analyzed by FORMSYS-DE, the in-house explicit FEM code. The results of the simulations show good general coincidence with those of the experiments reported in the literature.},

	abstract = {Elevated temperature has significant effect on the mechanical response of metals and alloys. Industrial processes often use high temperature forming to fabricate components of complex shape from alloys such as aluminum or magnesium that have low room temperature formability. Accurate forming models to integrate warm forming in computer aided engineering (CAE) in production environment has been hampered by a lack of constitutive relations at elevated temperatures, forcing one to rely on experimental data for such integration. In this paper, a new thermo elasto-viscoplastic (TEV) constitutive relation is developed to model the behavior of face-centred cubic (FCC) polycrystals, especially aluminum alloys, at elevated temperatures. The model takes into account the temperature dependence of the single crystal elastic coefficients, single slip hardening parameters, thermal softening, rate sensitivity, and the total deformation. The TEV framework has been implemented into the commercial finite element code LS-DYNA to study the effects of temperature on metal forming. Uniaxial tension simulations at six different temperatures ranging from 25 °C to 260 °C have been performed and calibrated with published experimental results. Equations for the variation of single-slip hardening parameters with temperature have been developed for the AA5754 aluminum alloy. Shear test simulations at different temperatures have been used to validate the model. The proposed framework for the single slip parameters for uniaxial tension accurately predicts the shear stress-shear strain data without the need for any further fitting parameter. Temperature dependence of texture evolution, single slip hardening and hardening rates, thermal softening, and slip activity in AA5754 sheet alloy during temperatures corresponding to warm forming temperatures are investigated.},

In summary, the key ingredients of this framework are: (i) the introduction of a plastic metric which is assumed to describe locally the history-dependent inelastic material response in the sense of an internal variable formulation. (ii) The definition of a convex elastic domain in the space of the local stress-like variable conjugate to the plastic metric, denoted as the plastic force. (iii) An equivalent Lagrangian and Eulerian representation of all constitutive functions as isotropic tensor functions in terms of an extended set of arguments, denoted as anisotropy variables. (iv) The set-up of normality rules for the evolution of the plastic metric and the anisotropy variables, yielding a canonical symmetric form of the elastoplastic tangent moduli. (v) A geometrically exact decomposition of the set of constitutive equations into possibly decoupled volumetric and isochoric contributions. Applications of the constitutive framework are demonstrated by means of several conceptual model problems which cover isotropic, initial anisotropic and induced anisotropic elastoplastic response.},

The distinguishing characteristic of the proposed constitutive updates is that, by construction, the corresponding incremental stress—strain relations derive from a pseudo-elastic strain-energy density. This, in turn, confers the incremental boundary value problem a variational structure. In particular, the incremental deformation mapping follows from a minimum principle. This minimum principle may conveniently be taken as a basis for error estimation and mesh adaption. The accuracy and robustness of the variational constitutive updates is demonstrated with the aid of convergence tests involving the finitely-deforming Mises solid and ductile single crystals. The ability of the updates to resolve the complex patterns of slip activity which arise in the latter application is particularly noteworthy.},

Additionally, the application range has been assessed. While the first order theory gives very good results for small strains below approximately 5\%, simulating large strains implies numerical instabilities evidenced by the violation of the volume balances. To this purpose, an extension of the algorithm used in TRANSURANUS was proposed and verified adopting different solution methods: an analytic solution and finite element calculations by means of COMSOL. In particular, creep calculations were carried out applying a Norton law that defines cladding creep strains under varying stress conditions. The verification against the numerical solution given by COMSOL and the analytic solution shows an excellent agreement of the radial profiles of stresses and strains.

The new code was applied to the simulation of cladding ballooning tests, and to an integral LOCA test of the FUMEX-III project. The impact of the new algorithm on the predicted time-to-burst and clad strain was assessed pointing out the effect of different failure criteria.},

The sensitivities of swelling to variations in composition, fabrication and environment lie almost exclusively in the duration of the transient regime of swelling.

INTRODUCTION  As of 1994, the performance of C++ for scientific computing was disappointing. Typical benchmark results showed C++ lagging behind Fortran's performance by anywhere from 20\% to a factor of ten. The performance of C++ was so poor that mixed-language programming was necessary: a program's framework could be written in C++, but any speed-critical routines had to be coded in Fortran. In the past five years there have been significant developments. There is now an optimizing C++ compiler available from Kuck and Associates (KAI C++) [4] which is able to perform C++ specific optimizations. Two new programming techniques (expression templates and template metaprograms) trick the compiler into performing optimizations such as loop fusion and algorithm specialization.

	abstract = {This paper presents a new numerical algorithm for the integration of the constitutive equations of a single crystal for finite rate-independent elastoplastic strains. The algorithm addressed in this paper is dedicated to face-centered-cubic (FCC) crystal structures. Its first feature is a much more efficient and more accurate integration scheme of the constitutive equations compared to previous attempts. This scheme is based on a fully implicit integration procedure, yet it may be transformed easily into an explicit scheme. Determining the set of active slip systems is performed by the use of a combinatorial search procedure, and the determination of the slip rates of the different active slip systems is based on the fixed point method. The second feature of this algorithm stems from the original method used to solve the ambiguity of the possible non-uniqueness of the set of active slip systems. A robust method, based on a small positive perturbation of the critical shear stresses, is proposed to overcome this difficulty. It is worth mentioning that the algorithm developed in this paper is not limited to one particular hardening law or to FCC crystal structures. Rather, it can be used and extended to various hardening laws and crystal structures (e.g. BCC or HCP…) in a straightforward manner. The authors demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm and illustrate its accuracy and efficiency through various numerical simulations at the single crystal and polycrystal scales. The predicted results obtained from those simulations were compared with those obtained using other numerical techniques and algorithms (i.e., a pseudo-inversion technique and an explicit algorithm). Our numerical predictions are also compared with some numerical and experimental results from other papers. The response of the polycrystal was computed by using the proposed algorithm combined with Taylor’s homogenization scheme, which is used to compute the overall polycrystalline behavior. The paper ends with a statistical study of the influence of the perturbation technique on the response prediction for a single crystal and a polycrystal.},

	abstract = {Si l’amorçage des fissures de fatigue est aujourd’hui bien compris dans le cas de monocristaux de métaux
purs, ce phénomène s’avère plus complexe à cerner et à prédire dans le cas d’alliages métalliques polycristallins
tels que l’acier AISI 316LN.
D’un point de vue expérimental, notre étude s’est concentrée sur la caractérisation du comportement mécanique
et l’étude, à différentes échelles, des phénomènes liés à l’amorçage des fissures de fatigue oligocyclique
dans l’acier 316LN. Pour des niveaux de déformation appliquée de =2 = 0; 3 et 0; 5\%, l’adoucissement cyclique
observé au cours des essais coïncide avec l’organisation des dislocations sous forme de bandes. Ces bandes se
forment suite à l’activation des systèmes de plus haut facteur de Schmid. Elles portent la majeure partie de la
déformation et provoquent en surface des intrusions et extrusions favorisant l’apparition et la coalescence de
fissures.
D’un point de vue modélisation, nous avons proposé un nouveau modèle de plasticité cristalline intégrant des
dislocations géométriquement nécessaires (GND) directement calculés à partir du second gradient de la rotation
élastique. Implémenté dans les codes d’éléments finis AbaqusTM et Cast3mTM, ce modèle s’inspire des travaux
sur le monocristal en transformation finie de Peirce et al. (1983) et de Teodosiu et al. (1993). Adapté au cas des
polycristaux par Hoc (1999) et Erieau (2003), il a été enrichi par l’introduction de GND selon la théorie proposée
par Acharya and Bassani (2000). Les simulations réalisées sur des différents types d’agrégats (2D extrudé et 3D)
montrent que le prise en compte de GND permet de :
– reproduire les effets de taille de grains au niveau macroscopique et local,
– décrire plus finement les champs de contraintes calculés.
Ces simulations ont aussi permis de mettre en évidence l’influence des matrices d’élasticité et d’écrouissage sur
les valeurs et l’évolution des contraintes macroscopiques effectives et cinématiques et le rôle important des conditions
aux limites lors des calculs d’agrégats.},

This multiphysics behavior is often tightly coupled and many important aspects are inherently multidimensional. Most current fuel modeling codes employ loose multiphysics coupling and are restricted to 2D axisymmetric or 1.5D approximations. This paper describes a new modeling tool able to simulate coupled multiphysics and multiscale fuel behavior, for either 2D axisymmetric or 3D geometries. Specific fuel analysis capabilities currently implemented in this tool are described, followed by a set of demonstration problems which include a 10-pellet light water reactor fuel rodlet, three-dimensional analysis of pellet clad mechanical interaction in the vicinity of a defective fuel pellet, coupled heat transfer and fission product diffusion in a TRISO-coated fuel particle, a demonstration of the ability to couple to lower-length scale models to account for material property variation with microstructural evolution, and a demonstration of the tool’s ability to efficiently solve very large and complex problems using massively-parallel computing. A final section describes an early validation exercise, comparing simulation results to a light water reactor fuel rod experiment.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a phenomenological material model for a superimposed elastic–viscoelastic–plastoelastic stress response with damage at large strains and considers details of its numerical implementation. The formulation is suitable for the simulation of carbon-black filled rubbers in monotonic and cyclic deformation processes under isothermal conditions. The underlying key approach is an experimentally motivated a priori decomposition of the local stress response into three constitutive branches which act in parallel: a rubber–elastic ground–stress response, a rate-dependent viscoelastic overstress response and a rate-independent plastoelastic overstress response. The damage is assumed to act isotropically on all three branches. These three branches are represented in a completely analogous format within separate eigenvalue spaces, where we apply a recently proposed compact setting of finite inelasticity based on developing reference metric tensors. On the numerical side, we propose a time integration scheme which exploits intrinsically the modular structure of the proposed constitutive model. This is achieved on the basis of a convenient operator split of the local evolution system, which we decouple into a stress evolution problem and a parameter evolution problem. The constitutive functions involved in the proposed model are specified for a particular filled rubber on the basis of a parameter identification process. The paper concludes with some numerical examples which demonstrate the overall response of the proposed model by means of a representative set of numerical examples.},

The theory is based on the additive decomposition of the logarithmic strain tensor. The stress conjugate to the logarithmic strain then plays the role of the thermodynamically driving force. The approach in this paper is motivated by the search for numerically accessible structures which can be extended to incorporate anisotropy as well. Specifically in this region, multiplicative formulations become extremely tedious. The evolution equations are of the unified type due to Bodner and Partom, and are modified so as to fit into the theoretical framework adopted. The numerical treatment of the problem is fully developed. Specifically, the algorithmic aspects of the approach are discussed and various applications to shell problems are considered. A shell theory with seven degrees of freedom, together with a four-node enhanced strain finite element formulation, is used. A central feature of the shell formulation is its eligibility to the application of a three-dimensional constitutive law.},

Mechanical properties, including tensile tests with different strain rates and tension–compression tests on notched specimens, have been characterized at unirradiated and irradiated states and used to calibrate constitutive equations to describe the mechanical behavior as a function of temperature and fluence. Irradiation embrittlement has been determined based on Charpy V-notch impact tests and isothermal quasi-static toughness tests. Assessment of WPS effect has been done through various types of thermomechanical loadings performed on CT(0.5 T) specimens. All tests have confirmed the non-failure during the thermo-mechanical transients. Experimental data obtained in this study have been compared to both engineering-based models and to a local approach (Beremin) model for cleavage fracture. It is shown that both types of modeling give good predictions for the effective toughness after warm prestressing.},

First, a semi analytical one-dimensional study is carried out on a bar submitted to tensile loading (in the case of inhomogeneous symmetrical damage localisation) in order to identify a set of cohesive laws allowing to switch from damage growth to cohesive crack opening. This continuous/discontinuous approach is constructed so that energetic equivalence between both models remains ensured whatever the damage level reached when switching. This strategy is then extended to the finite element framework, in the case of 2D (and 3D) crack propagation under mode I loading conditions. Both non local and cohesive models are combined using a critical damage criterion which is checked at the end of each converged time step.},

	title = {Modélisation de la rupture ductile des internes de cuve irradiés - {Rapport} de 1ère année de {Thèse}},
	abstract = {Ce rapport constitue le bilan de la première année de thèse de C. LING dédiée à la « Modélisation de la
rupture ductile des internes de cuve irradiés ». L'objectif de cette thèse est de poursuivre et d’étendre les
travaux de la thèse de Xu Han (2009-2012) avec pour finalité de proposer une modélisation de l’effet des
cavités à l'échelle cristalline sur les propriétés mécaniques et notamment sur l’évolution de la ténacité des
structures Internes. Les résultats obtenus lors de la première année de thèse sont :
i.
ii.
iii.
Les lois de plasticité cristallines proposées par Xu Han pour décrire le comportement en fonction
de la dose ont été implémentées en petites déformations et en grandes transformations dans le
générateur de lois de comportement Mfront utilisable à terme dans Cast3m, dans Code\_Aster
(EDF) et dans le code Zset (Mines Paristech). Les tests de traction sur l’implémentation dans
Mfront ont été réalisés en comparaison avec les mêmes tests dans le code Z-set. Un bon accord
entre les deux codes a été observé avec le jeu de paramètres simplifiés (matrice d’interaction
entre systèmes de glissement homogène) validant l’implémentation dans Mfront. L’utilisation
d’une matrice d’interaction non-homogène telle que déterminée à partir des calculs de dynamique
de dislocations révèle de faibles écarts pour certaines directions cristallographiques lorsque le
comportement montre une phase d’adoucissement (état irradié). L’origine de ces écarts en en
cours d’étude.
Le formalisme en grandes transformations du modèle monocristallin homogénéisé poreux
proposé dans la thèse de Xu Han a été explicité et est présenté dans son intégralité dans ce
rapport.
L’extension du modèle d’homogénéisation monocristallin poreux à la description de la croissance
des cavités a été étudiée. Le caractère prédictif du modèle monocristallin poreux tel que proposé
par Xu Han a été étudié en comparant les comportements de référence (obtenus par calculs sur
la cellule poreuse) et à la réponse obtenue sur élément de volume. A partir des 456 calculs sur
cellule, il est mis en évidence un bon accord entre les vitesses de croissance obtenues par le
modèle homogénéisé et les calculs de référence pour un grand nombre de cas (orientation
cristallographique, porosité, triaxialité). Cependant, plusieurs cas ont été identifiés où la vitesse
de croissance de cavité est surestimée par le modèle homogénéisé. Des écarts significatifs sont
obtenus principalement pour des triaxialités entre 1/3 et 2. Afin d’étudier l’origine de ces écarts,
des équations analytiques ont été développées sous certaines hypothèses permettant d’obtenir la
solution exacte de la vitesse de croissance des cavités. Pour ces conditions particulières, il est
ainsi montré que les résultats du modèle homogénéisé obtenus par la simulation sont en accord
avec le calcul analytique, mais que ces résultats ne sont pas en accord avec ceux des calculs de
référence sur cellule poreuse. Deux phénomènes ont été identifiés comme cause possible des
écarts observés dans les calculs sur cellule poreuse (localisation de la déformation et bifurcation
numérique) et sont actuellement en cours d’étude. Par ailleurs, pour les très fortes triaxialités
({\textgreater}20), un écart entre les surfaces de charge effectives du modèle homogénéisé et celle issue du
calcul de référence a été identifié, mais ces niveaux de triaxialité ne sont pas d’intérêt pour notre
étude.
La deuxième de la thèse sera consacrée à : (i) la poursuite de l’étude du modèle homogénéisé
particulièrement pour la phase de coalescence, (ii) la prise en compte de l’effet de taille des cavités
en proposant un formalisme de plasticité à gradient qui sera intégré au modèle homogénéisé, (iii)
l’évaluation du comportement mécanique d’éprouvette de traction en présence d’une fissure.},

These moduli determine the sensitivity of algorithmic expressions for stresses with respect to the change in total deformation. They serve as iteration operators by application of Newton-type solvers for the iterative solution of non-linear initial-boundary-value problems in finite inelasticity. The underlying concept of the numerical computation is a perturbation technique based on a forward difference approximation which reduces the computation of the tangent moduli to a multiple stress computation. The algorithmic procedure is material-independent and surprisingly simple. It is outlined for a Lagrangian, as well as an Eulerian geometric setting and applied to model problems of finite elasticity and finite elastoplasticity.},

	abstract = {L’étude décrite dans ce document s’inscrit dans le contexte du développement du réacteur ASTRID. Les travaux des ingénieurs sur le réacteur combinent des études de dimensionnement où les différents
éléments sont représentés sous forme de plaque et de poutre. Ces calculs sont souvent suffisants, mais se pose parfois la question d’interpréter les résultats obtenus quand des concentrations de contraintes apparaissent et mettent à défaut les hypothèses de calcul poutre. En particulier, il faut pouvoir recalculer les contraintes sur l’élément "réel".

Ces calculs poutre peuvent également servir à :
1) avoir des conditions aux limites pour des calculs massifs,
2) transférer des efforts entre différents calculs 3D par l’intermédiaire d’une modélisation poutre.
La première partie de cette étude a pour objectifs de tester des méthodes de relocalisation déjà existantes et d’en mettre de nouvelles en place. Ces méthodes de relocalisation sont des méthodes
de raccord entre une modélisation poutre et une modélisation massif. Une première méthode a été implémentée dans le code de calcul Cast3m, et transmet la cinématique poutre au modèle massif
en considérant l’hypothèse des petites rotations de sections. Une deuxième méthode de raccord sera envisagée en se basant sur la méthode d’homogénéisation d’Etienne Castelier. A ce jour, il reste à
"l’industrialiser".

La seconde partie est consacrée à la modélisation de l’insertion d’une barre de commande dans son fourreau de barre, dans le cadre de désalignements pouvant être causés par un séisme. Deux
modèles seront envisagés, amanenant chacun une vision différente du phénomène. La vérification et la comparaison des modèles seront établies et conduiront à proposer un outil de calcul qui sera utilisé par
les concepteurs de coeur de réacteur. Cet outil constitue une première phase dans l’étude mécanique de la barre de commande. Les résultats obtenus devront être post-traités avec les procédures de raccord proposées pour pouvoir relocaliser les contraintes dans le matériau.
L’essentiel du stage s’est fait avec Cast3m pour le prototypage. Ces méthodes de raccord et de relocalisation ont pour objectif final d’être intégrée dans le code de calcul Licos afin d’obtenir un outil
le plus simple possible.},

	abstract = {In the frame of their research programmes on fuel safety, the French Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire develops the SCANAIR code devoted to the study of irradiated fuel rod behaviour during reactivity initiated accident. A first paper was focused on detailed modellings and code description. This second paper deals with the status of the code validation for pressurised water reactor rods performed thanks to the available experimental results. About 60 integral tests carried out in CABRI and NSRR experimental reactors and 24 separated tests performed in the PATRICIA facility (devoted to the thermal-hydraulics study) have been recalculated and compared to experimental data. During the first stage of the transient, the pellet clad mechanical interaction phase, there is a good agreement between calculations and experiments: the clad residual elongation and hoop strain of non failed tests but also the failure occurrence and failure enthalpy of failed tests are correctly calculated. After this first stage, the increase of cladding temperature can lead to the Departure from Nucleate Boiling. During the film boiling regime, the clad temperature can reach a very high temperature (\&gt;700 °C). If the boiling crisis occurrence is rather well predicted, the calculation of the clad temperature and the clad hoop strain during this stage have still to be improved.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a formulation of large-strain rate-independent multisurface thermoplasticity for single crystals and addresses aspects of its numerical implementation. The theoretical frame is the well-established continuum slip theory based on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into elastic and plastic parts. A key feature of the present paper is the introduction and computational exploitation of a particularly simple hyperelastic stress response function based on a further multiplicative decomposition of the elastic deformation gradient into spherical and unimodular parts, resulting in a very convenient representation of the Schmid resolved shear stresses on the crystallographic slip systems in terms of a simple inner product of Eulerian vectors. This observation is intrinsically exploited on the numerical side by formulating a new fully implicit stress update algorithm and the associated consistent elastoplastic moduli in terms of these Eulerian vectors. The proposed return mapping algorithm treats the possibly redundant constraints of large-strain multisurface plasticity for single crystals by means of an active set search. Furthermore, it satisfies in an algorithmically exact way the plastic incompressibility condition in situations of multislip. The performance of the proposed formulation is demonstrated for two representative numerical simulations of thermoplastic deformation processes in single crystals with isotropic Taylor-type hardening.},

For three-dimensional solids, the independent rotation field is the rotation tensor from the polar decomposition of the deformation gradient.

Doing so requires taking into account the coupled effects of heat transfer, the mechanical interaction between the fuel and its surrounding protection, the isotopic evolution caused by the irradiation, and the chemical interactions between fuel, fission products, cladding, and coolant. In view of the strong interactions between the various aspects of fuel performance and the resulting mathematical problems, the simulation of the fuel behavior requires fuel performance codes, which are being used by safety authorities, research organizations, and fuel vendors. The basic equations for each aspect of the codes are described in this chapter, together with the specific features of and modeling requirements for the design basis accident analysis. Finally, this chapter also outlines the advanced issues and future needs of fuel performance codes for nuclear fuel rods based on oxides.},

Fuel performance codes have two main goals{\textasciitilde}: describing the overall

This tutorial class aims at introducing the main basis of such

The coupled thermo-mechanical boundary-value problem under consideration consists of the equilibrium problem for a deformable, inelastic and dissipative solid with the heat conduction problem appended in addition. The variational formulation allows for general dissipative solids, including finite elastic and plastic deformations, non-Newtonian viscosity, rate sensitivity, arbitrary flow and hardening rules, as well as heat conduction. We show that a joint potential function exists such that both the conservation of energy and the balance of linear momentum equations follow as Euler–Lagrange equations. The identification of the joint potential requires a careful distinction between equilibrium and external temperatures, which are equal at equilibrium. The variational framework predicts the fraction of dissipated energy that is converted to heat. A comparison of this prediction and experimental data suggests that α -titanium and Al2024-T conform to the variational framework.},

The formulation is developed using hyperelasticity in terms of logarithmic strains, the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into an elastic and a plastic part, and the exponential mapping. The novelty in the computational procedure is that it retains the conceptual simplicity of the large strain isotropic elasto-plastic algorithms based on the same ingredients. The plastic correction is performed using a standard small strain procedure in which the stresses are interpreted as generalized Kirchhoff stresses and the strains as logarithmic strains, and the large strain kinematics is reduced to a geometric pre- and post-processor. The procedure is independent of the specified yield function and type of hardening used, and for isotropic elasticity, the algorithm of Eterović and Bathe is automatically recovered as a special case. The results of some illustrative finite element solutions are given in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the algorithm.},

	abstract = {The article presents new aspects of large-strain isotropic elastoplastic analysis of shells. On the shell theory side, we consider several possible continuum based parametrizations of the shell deformation and investigate their applicability with respect to the implementation of general three-dimensional local constitutive models. As an aspect of computational shell analysis we then discuss in detail the numerical implementation of a shell based on the parametrization of the top and bottom surface in terms of a new 8-node brick-type mixed finite shell element on the basis of assumed strain and enhanced strain variational approaches. On the side of plasticity theory we adopt a recently proposed intermediate-configuration-free formulation of large-strain plasticity based on the notion of a plastic metric and consider its representation with respect to the parameter manifold of the shell. This frame is formulated in terms of principal strains and principal stresses with respect to dual co- and contra-variant eigenvector triads associated with a mixed-variant elastic strain tensor. The new aspect of computational plasticity is the development of a stress update algorithm for the plasticity model mentioned above which includes a general return mapping in the eigenvalue space. The algorithm can be applied to general coordinate charts and is particularly convenient when formulated with respect to the space of the curvilinear coordinates of the shell parametrization. We demonstrate the performance of the finite element formulation and constitutive algorithms by means of several numerical examples.},

	abstract = {A variational formulation is proposed for a family of elastic–plastic–damage models within the framework of rate-independent materials. That consists first in defining the total energy which contains, in particular, a gradient damage term and a term which represents the plastic dissipation but depends also on damage. Then, the evolution law is deduced from the principles of irreversibility, stability and energy balance. Accordingly, the plastic dissipation term which appears both in the damage criterion and the plastic yield criterion plays an essential role in the damage–plasticity coupling. Suitable constitutive choices on how the plastic yield stress decreases with damage, allows us to obtain a rich variety of coupled responses. A particular attention is paid on the equations which govern the formation of cohesive cracks where the displacement is discontinuous and the plasticity localizes. In the one-dimensional traction test where the solution is obtained in a closed form, we show that, because of damage localization, a cohesive crack really appears at the center of the damage zone before the rupture and the associated cohesive law is obtained in closed form in terms of the constitutive parameters. A Finite Element discrete version of the energy functional is used to simulate a two-dimensional traction test over a rectangular domain with mixed boundary conditions; again a localized band of plastic strain is generated seemingly independent of the mesh size.},

After time discretisation, the evolution of the internal variable field is characterised by a minimum principle.

Nous nous intéressons ensuite à l'intégration algorithmique de ces deux lois . On montre que le modèle retenu et implanté dans le Code Aster (Sùnq Miehe) permet de traiter de manière exacte les grandes rotations, ce qui n'est pas le cas avec un modèle en vitesse . On propose pour le modèle retenu une formulation variationnelle discrétisée eulérienne, avec réactualisation de la géométrie et qui tient compte de la rigidité de comportement et de la rigidité géométrique. Cette formulation est donnée dans le cas d'un problème tridimensionnel, axisymétrique ou en déformations planes . Nous donnons également deux approches plus simples sur le plan algorithmique qui traitent les cas où les déformations sont grandes et les rotations petites (PETIT RÉAC) et inversement . A travers quelques exemples numériques, on montre d'une part que le modèle implanté donne bien une solution exacte en présence de grandes rotations, ce qui n'est pas le cas en utilisant PETIT\_REAC et d'autre part que les temps de calculs sont, pour les cas tests réalisés, inférieurs à ceux de

On the theoretical side, a Eulerian setting of isotropic thermoelasticity is discussed, based on the Finger tensor as a strain measure. Novel aspects are a direct representation of the Eulerian thermoelastic moduli in terms of the Finger tensor and a rigorous decomposition of the thermoelastic response functions into decoupled volumetric and isochoric contributions based on a multiplicative split of the Finger tensor into spherical and unimodular parts. An algorithmic procedure for the computation of the stress and thermoelastic moduli, based on a representation of the free energy in terms of eigenvalues of the unimodular part of the Finger tensor, is developed and applied to model problems of strictly entropic and modified entropic thermoelasticity. Furthermore, two algorithms for the solution of the coupled problem are discussed, based on operator splits of the global field equations of thermoelasticity. The paper concludes with some representative numerical simulations of thermoelastic processes in rubber-like materials.},

	abstract = {Dans les réacteurs nucléaires à eau sous-pression, le combustible est constitué de pastilles d’oxyde d’uranium (UO2), dont le comportement ne peut être simulé qu'à travers une modélisation multi-échelles et multi-physiques, tenant compte à la fois de la thermo-mécanique et de la physico-chimie relative aux produits de fission. L’évolution récente des modèles et des moyens de calcul a permis de développer les simulations à l’échelle de la microstructure et d’accroitre les possibilités de couplage. Ce travail concerne le développement d'un modèle de comportement thermo-mécanique de l’UO2 à l’échelle du polycristal. Le comportement du VER est analysé en termes de réponse effective et de phénomènes de localisation. Nous nous intéressons notamment aux valeurs de pression hydrostatique, qui pilotent le transport des produits de fission. La robustesse des résultats obtenus en fonction du choix du maillage éléments finis est étudiée. Une série de calculs est présentée afin de trouver un compromis satisfaisant en termes de discrétisation pour une estimation correcte des contraintes locales.	Une première étude propose de retrouver des mesures expérimentales de dé cohésion intergranulaire sur le combustible en introduisant des modèles de zones cohésives dans le VER. Afin d'analyser le comportement micromécanique de l’UO2 en irradiation, un chargement de type rampe de puissance est appliqué au polycristal. L’analyse des distributions locales de contraintes donne lieu à une discussion sur l’effet de l’incompatibilité intergranulaire sur le transport des produits de fission.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a framework for the treatment of a homogenized macro-continuum with locally attached micro-structure, which undergoes non-isothermal inelastic deformations at large strains. The proposed concept is applied to the simulation of texture evolution in polycrystalline metals, where the micro-structure consists of a representative assembly of single crystal grains. The deformation of this micro-structure is coupled with the local deformation at a typical material point of the macro-continuum by three alternative constraints of the microscopic fluctuation field. In a deformation driven process, extensive macroscopic variables, like stresses and dissipation are defined as volume averages of their microscopic counterparts in an accompanying local equilibrium state of the micro-structure. The proposed numerical implementation is based in the general setting on a finite element discretization of the macro-continuum which is locally coupled at each Gauss point with a finite element discretization of the attached micro-structure. In the first part of the paper we set up the two coupled boundary value problems associated with the macro-continuum and the pointwise attached micro-structure and consider aspects of their finite element solutions. The second part presents details of a robust algorithmic model of finite plasticity for single crystals which governs the response of the grains in a typical micro-structure. The paper concludes with some representative numerical examples by demonstrating the performance of the proposed concept with regard to the prediction of texture evolution in polycrystals.},

Jusqu'à présent, beaucoup efforts ont été contribués pour identifier les effets d'irradiation sur l'évolution microstructurale du matériau (dislocations, boucles de Frank, cavités, ségrégation, etc.). Le gonflement induit par irradiation, considéré comme un facteur limitant la durée de fonctionnement des réacteurs, pourrait modifier les propriétés mécaniques des matériaux (plasticité, ténacité, etc), même conduire à une distorsion des structures du fait des modifications dimensionnelles entre les différentes composantes.L'objectif principal de ce travail de thèse est d'étudier qualitativement l'influence de l'effet du gonflement sur le comportement mécanique des matériaux irradiés. Un modèle micromécanique constitutif en grandes déformations basé sur les évolutions de la densité de dislocations et de défauts d'irradiation (boucles de Frank) est développé et implémenté dans les codes de calcul éléments finis ZéBuLoN et Cast3M. Les simulations numériques sont réalisées pour calculer les propriétés mécaniques d'un agrégat polycristallin. Par ailleurs, la technique d'homogénéisation est appliquée pour développer un modèle de type Gurson. Les simulations d'une cellule poreuse sont utilisés pour étudier le comportement mécanique des monocristaux poreux, en tenant compte des différents effets de la triaxialité, de la porosité et de l'orientation cristallographique, afin d'étudier l'effet de la présence des cavités sur la plasticité et la rugosité du matériau irradié à l'échelle polycristallin.},

A universal interface for arbitrary material laws is introduced from which easy addition and expansion of the material library can take place. Although such expansion using a generic interface is by definition polymorphic, the idiom is carried much further in several aspects of program design. Deriving from abstract examples of equation and algorithmic encapsulation, simple elastic damage and complex inelastic constitutive laws are developed. Examples of calculations show that adequate performance is given by C++ with respect to Fortran77 for simple to very complex material laws. The performance is seen to be a much stronger function of the compiler used than the actual numerical complexity.},

	abstract = {This study is concerned with the modelling of fuel behaviour and of pellet–cladding interaction (PCI). A new fuel software (PLEIADES) is currently co-developed by the Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) and Electricité de France (EDF). This software includes a multi-dimensional FE program (ALCYONE) devoted to Pressure Water Reactors (PWR) fuel rods. PCI studies are mainly undertaken with the 3D model of ALCYONE. The objectives of this work are twofold: first, to propose a constitutive model for the fuel pellet which accounts for the stress relaxation of the material resulting from cracking and creep, second, to estimate the impact of the pellet cracking on PCI.

In this paper, a mathematical formulation which couples a viscoplastic law for creep with a multi-surface plastic softening law for cracking is detailed, leading a two inelastic strains model. Mesh dependency is overcome thanks to a material parameter related to the finite element size. The 3D calculations of PCI presented in this paper show that the considered modelling of fuel cracking is consistent with the experimental knowledge available on crack development under irradiation. A parametric study is then presented which leads to the conclusion that the tangential stresses at the pellet cladding interface and hence the risk of PCI failure are significantly reduced when the fuel tensile strength is divided by two.},

Utilizing the mathematical structure present in JFNK, physics expressions are modularized into “Kernels,” allowing for rapid production of new simulation tools. In addition, systems are solved implicitly and fully coupled, employing physics-based preconditioning, which provides great flexibility even with large variance in time scales.

	abstract = {This paper presents the development of a physical-based constitutive model for the representation of viscous effects in rubber-like materials. The proposed model originates from micromechanically motivated diffusion processes of the highly mobile polymer chains described within the formalism of Brownian motion. Following the basic assumption of accounting for the elastic and the viscous effects in rubber viscoelasticity by their representation through a separate elastic ground network and several viscous subnetworks, respectively, the kinetic theory of rubber elasticity is followed and extended to represent also the viscous contribution in this work. It is assumed that the stretch probability of certain chain segments within an individual viscous subnetwork evolves based on the movement of the chain endpoints described by the Smoluchowski equation extended in this work from non-interacting point particles in a viscous surrounding to flexible polymer chains. An equivalent tensorial representation for this evolution is chosen which allows for the closed form solution of the macroscopic free energy and the macroscopic viscous overstress based on a homogenization over the probability space of the introduced micro-objects. The resulting model of the viscous subnetwork is subsequently combined with the non-affine micro-sphere model and applied in homogeneous and non-homogeneous tests. Finally, the model capacity is outlined based on a comparison with in the literature available experimental data sets.},

	abstract = {Grade 347 from Aperam South America is a stainless steel elaborated to meet the international standards
AISI 347 and AISI 347H. Due to the stabilization with niobium, this grade has the corrosion resistance at high
temperatures as its main characteristic. When submitted to temperatures ranging from 450-900 oC, some
grades tend to form chromium carbide precipitate in the grain boundary region, and the material becomes
susceptible to intergranular corrosion. The stabilization with niobium inhibits the formation of chromium
carbide, and consequently increases the resistance to this type of corrosion.
Grade AISI 347 has excellent weldability, a characteristic common to austenitic steels, as well as high mechanical
properties, which guarantees good ductability, and it s recommended for some cold forming processes.
The application of grade AISI 347 is mainly intended for corrosive environments and high temperatures. It
is currently being used in the manufacture of collector rings for aircrafts, engine components for rockets,
exhaust manifold for cars, expansion joints and equipment for chemical processing at high temperatures.},

La méthode est développée pour des matériaux élastoviscoplastiques incompressibles. La transformée de Karhunen-Loève est proposée pour optimiser le choix des modes plastiques. Puis la méthode est étendue aux matériaux élastoviscoplastiques poreux. Enfin, la TFA développée par Dvorak est appliquée aux combustibles nucléaires MOX. Cette méthode permet de faire des études de sensibilité pour déterminer le rôle de paramètres microstructuraux sur le comportement du combustible. De plus l'adéquation de la NTFA avec les MOX est démontrée, le but étant d'appliquer le modèle aux MOX en 3D},

We demonstrate that the changes only concern the mechanical behaviour integration step by a straightforward modification of the strains (inputs) and the stress (result).

The proposed procedure has been implemented in the open-source MFront code generator developed within the PLEIADES platform to handle mechanical behaviours. Using the Alcyone performance code, we apply this procedure to a simulation case proposed within the framework of a recent benchmark on fuel performance codes by the OECD/NEA.},

The first is to determine which slip systems are active, and the second is to determine the increments of shear on the active slip systems. Third, because of the typical multiplicity of slip systems in ductile crystals, the selection of slip systems required to produce an arbitrary deformation increment is not necessarily unique. The purpose of this paper is to present a robust calculation scheme which determines a unique set of active slip systems and the corresponding shear increments in a rate-independent theory. We show by comparing the predictions from our computational procedure for the rate-independent theory against corresponding predictions from a procedure for a similar but rate-dependent theory (with a low value of the rate sensitivity parameter) that the results from the two procedures are essentially indistinguishable.},

In bcc crystals, the mobility of dislocations strongly depends on temperature and dislocation line characters. Unlike the classical picture of the Orowan mechanism, simulations show that the difference in mobility between screw and non-screw characters is the key parameter. Simulations at different temperatures and with different precipitate microstructures illustrate the contribution of two mechanisms to Orowan strengthening: a thermally activated mechanism induced by the length dependency of the screw dislocation mobility and an athermal mechanism associated with dislocation line tension. The influence of the particle distribution is studied with a comparison between regular and random particle arrangements. In most cases, distribution effect can be accounted for by calculating effective particle spacing in the screw dislocation directions.},

This model is applied to uniaxial tension tests for fee polycrystals. Both plastic flow and texture development are investigated. Internal stresses are shown to be significantly lowered with respect to the Kröner model predictions, due to the occurrence of plastic stress relaxation. As a result, the specific plastic properties of the material which are studied, as expressed by a single crystal “hardening matrix”, are found to have a significant influence on the final results.},

	abstract = {In this paper, effects of irradiation damage and crystal size on the mechanical behaviors of FCC single crystals are explored. By treating the spatial dependent interaction between dislocations and irradiation-induced stacking fault tetrahedrons (SFTs) as a tensorial form and taking into account the influence of dislocation source limitation at submicron (∼100 nm to ∼1 μm), a unified size-dependent tensorial plasticity model for irradiated single crystals is developed. The feasibility and accuracy of this model are well validated by comparing numerical results with corresponding experimental data. It is found that (1) the yield strength of unirradiated FCC copper increases with the decrease of crystal size, which mainly attributed to the mechanism shifting from dislocation forest strengthening to dislocation source limitation strengthening. (2) For large crystal copper, the yield strength increases with the amount of irradiation, which is attributed to the increase of irradiation-induced SFTs and enhancement of dislocation–defect interaction. The phenomenon of yield dropping is observed when the irradiation is strong. (3) The competition between the irradiation effect and size effect induces the existence of a critical crystal size. Below the critical size, the yield hardening is controlled by size effect. Otherwise, it is controlled by irradiation effect. Furthermore, the proposed model can easily predict this critical crystal size, which may provide a quick guideline to distinguish different hardening mechanisms regarding different crystal sizes.},

Additionally, the application range has been assessed. While the first order theory gives very good results for small strains below approximately 5\%, simulating large strains implies numerical instabilities evidenced by the violation of the volume balances. To this purpose, an extension of the algorithm used in TRANSURANUS was proposed and verified adopting different solution methods: an analytic solution and finite element calculations by means of COMSOL. In particular, creep calculations were carried out applying a Norton law that defines cladding creep strains under varying stress conditions. The verification against the numerical solution given by COMSOL and the analytic solution shows an excellent agreement of the radial profiles of stresses and strains.

The new code was applied to the simulation of cladding ballooning tests, and to an integral LOCA test of the FUMEX-III project. The impact of the new algorithm on the predicted time-to-burst and clad strain was assessed pointing out the effect of different failure criteria.},

Simplifying assumptions are usually adopted to reduce this number. A new method has been proposed [Michel JC, Suquet P. Nonuniform transformation field analysis. Int J Solids Struct 2003;40:6937–55], based on the transformation fields approach [Dvorak G. Transformation field analysis of inelastic composite materials. Proc Roy Soc Lond A 1992;437:311–27], but not taking transformation fields to be necessarily uniform. The interest of this new method has been shown in the case of composites with elastic–plastic constituents. Here we deal with composites having elastic–viscoplastic and porous elastic–viscoplastic constituents. In the latter case, the viscoplastic strain has a dilatational part.},

Following Aravas’ influential 1987 paper, Newton’s method has been used widely to solve the GTN equations. However, if the starting point is far from the solution, then Newton’s method can fail to converge. Hybrid methods are preferred in such cases. In this work we translate the GTN equations into a non-linear minimization problem and then apply the Levenberg–Marquardt and Powell’s ‘dogleg’ hybrid methods to solve it. The methods are tested for accuracy and robustness on two simple single finite element models and two 3D models with complex deformation paths. In total nearly 137,000 different GTN problems were solved. We show that the Levenberg–Marquardt method is more robust than Powell’s method. Our results are verified against the Abaqus’ own solver. The superior accuracy of the Levenberg–Marquardt method allows for larger time increments in implicit time integration schemes.},

	abstract = {The PLEIADES software environment is devoted to the thermomechanical simulation of nuclear fuel elements behaviour under irradiation. This platform is co-developed in the framework of a research cooperative program between Électricité de France (EDF), AREVA and the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). As many thermomechanical solvers are used within the platform, one of the PLEAIADES’s main challenge is to propose a unified software environment for capitalisation of material knowledge coming from research and development programs on various nuclear systems.

This paper introduces a tool called mfront which is basically a code generator based on C++  (Stroustrup and Eberhardt, 2004). Domain specific languages are provided which were designed to simplify the implementations of new material properties, mechanical behaviours and simple material models. mfront was recently released under the GPL open-source licence and is available on its web site: http://tfel.sourceforge.net/.

The authors hope that it will prove useful for researchers and engineers, in particular in the field of solid mechanics. mfront interfaces generate code specific to each solver and language considered.

In this paper, after a general overview of mfront functionalities, a particular focus is made on mechanical behaviours which are by essence more complex and may have significant impact on the numerical performances of mechanical simulations. mfront users can describe all kinds of mechanical phenomena, such as viscoplasticity, plasticity and damage, for various types of mechanical behaviour (small strain or finite strain behaviour, cohesive zone models). Performance benchmarks, performed using the Code\_Aster finite element solver, show that the code generated using mfront is in most cases on par or better than the behaviour implementations written in fortran natively available in this solver. The material knowledge management strategy that was set up within the PLEIADES platform is briefly discussed. A material database named sirius proposes a rigorous material verification workflow.

We illustrate the use of mfront through two case of studies: a simple FFC single crystal viscoplastic behaviour and the implementation of a recent behaviour for the fuel material which describes various phenomena: fuel cracking, plasticity and viscoplasticity.},

Several results of two-dimensional FE analyses carried out by AREVA NP are shown. It appears that fuel pellet cracking during power ramp test is due to the friction between fuel pellet and cladding. The influence of fuel fracture properties is also investigated, focusing on the consequences on clad loading. These results are used to improve the modeling of PCI in AREVA NP’s future global fuel rod performance code COPERNIC3.},

The classes address the reduction of interdependence in the code project, and facility expandability in the long term. Application of these abstract programming techniques are given within the context of a complete, working FEM code design which employs the object techniques thoroughly on every level of the computation. Furthermore, suggestions are given on how to reformulate problems in an object-oriented fashion in order to plan on expandability.

Enhanced capabilities are described, including: UO2 temperature and burnup dependent thermal properties, solid and gaseous fission product swelling, fuel densification, fission gas release, cladding thermal and irradiation creep, cladding irradiation growth, gap heat transfer, and gap/plenum gas behavior during irradiation. This new capability is demonstrated using a 2D axisymmetric analysis of the upper section of a simplified multipellet fuel rod, during both steady and transient operation. Comparisons are made between discrete and smeared-pellet simulations. Computational results demonstrate the importance of a multidimensional, multipellet, fully-coupled thermomechanical approach. Interestingly, many of the inherent deficiencies in existing fuel performance codes (e.g., 1D thermomechanics, loose thermomechanical coupling, separate steady and transient analysis, cumbersome pre- and post-processing) are, in fact, ABAQUS strengths.},

The overall behavior of these types of composite materials is obtained with the help of quadratic strain-rate potentials combined with experimental-based coupling function depending on stress and temperature. For each creeping mechanism, the hollow sphere model of [Michel, J.-C., Suquet, P., 1992. The constitutive law of nonlinear viscous and porous materials.

Mechanical parameters of the resulting model are identified and validated in the particular case of non-irradiated uranium dioxide nuclear ceramics. This model predicts, under pure thermo-mechanical loading, a variation of the material volume and a variation of the porosity volume fraction (the so-called densification or swelling).},

The model relies on a multiplicative viscoplastic formulation and reproduces strain hardening, strain rate sensitivity and plastic anisotropy of the material. It includes temperature, fluence and irradiation conditions dependences within RIA typical ranges. Model parameters have been tuned using axial tensile, hoop tensile and closed-end internal pressurization tests results essentially obtained from the PROMETRA program, dedicated to the study of zirconium alloys under RIA loading conditions. Once calibrated, the model provides a reliable description of the mechanical behavior of the fresh and irradiated (fluence up to 10 × 10 25 nm - 2 or burnup up to 64 GWd/tU) material within large temperature (from 20 °C up to 1100 °C) and strain rate ranges (from 3 × 10 - 4 s - 1 up to 5 s - 1 ), representative of the RIA spectrum. Finally, the model is used for the finite element analysis of the hoop tensile tests performed within the PROMETRA program.},

	abstract = {Since the early 1990s, the French “Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire” (IRSN) has developed the SCANAIR computer code with the view to analysing pressurised water reactor (PWR) safety. This software specifically focuses on studying fast transients such as reactivity-initiated accidents (RIA) caused by possible ejection of control rods. The code aims at improving the global understanding of the physical mechanisms governing the thermal-mechanical behaviour of a single rod. It is currently used to analyse integral tests performed in CABRI and NSRR experimental reactors. The resulting validated code is used to carry out studies required to evaluate margins in relation to criteria for different types of fuel rods used in nuclear power plants.

Because phenomena occurring during fast power transients are complex, the simulation in SCANAIR is based on a close coupling between several modules aimed at modelling thermal, thermal-hydraulics, mechanical and gas behaviour. During the first stage of fast power transients, clad deformation is mainly governed by the pellet–clad mechanical interaction (PCMI). At the later stage, heat transfers from pellet to clad bring the cladding material to such high temperatures that the boiling crisis might occurs. The significant over-pressurisation of the rod and the fact of maintaining the cladding material at elevated temperatures during a fairly long period can lead to ballooning and possible clad failure.

A brief introduction describes the context, the historical background and recalls the main phenomena involved under fast transient conditions. Then, the main features of the SCANAIR computer code (version 7) are presented. The present paper is particularly focused on the detailed description of the thermal dynamics, the structural mechanics until the prediction of the clad failure and the gas behaviour modellings. A further paper will be focused on the code validation.},

conditions accidentelles et d’aider ainsi à la modélisation du comportement en APRP des gaines
fortement irradiées, un programme expérimental a été réalisé depuis ces 5 dernières années sur
l’alliage M5 pré-hydruré. Cette note de synthèse rappelle toutes les données expérimentales
métallurgiques obtenues pour le M5 pré-hydruré entre {\textasciitilde}100 et {\textasciitilde}900 ppm-masse, et décrit un
modèle cinétique de la transformation de phases α⇔β pour le M5 pré-hydruré entre {\textasciitilde}100 et
{\textasciitilde}250 ppm-masse, teneurs enveloppes d’un M5 « fin de vie ». En parallèle, cette note présente
l’ensemble du programme d’essais mécaniques de fluage et de rampes de température menés sur
l’alliage M5 pré-hydruré à {\textasciitilde}150 ppm-masse (représentatif d’un M5 « fin de vie ») et à {\textasciitilde}650
ppm-masse (pour comparaison avec les résultats obtenus à ces teneurs pour le Zy4 AFA-2G).
Pour des teneurs supérieures à {\textasciitilde}100 ppm-masse, on observe un effet de l'hydrogène sur les
températures de transformation de phases, aussi bien à l'équilibre qu'en cinétique. Comme déjà
observé pour le Zy4, cet élément bêta gène abaisse les transus de transformation de phases α⇔β
du M5TM. Néanmoins, l'impact d'une teneur de 150ppm-masse reste relativement faible, avec un
effet de l'ordre de 30°C sur le transus bas Tα→α+β de la courbe à l'équilibre.
Pour une teneur de {\textasciitilde}650 ppm-masse, l’hydrogène modifie notablement le comportement
mécanique de l’alliage M5 en diminuant la résistance au fluage et la ductilité à rupture. Par
contre, il s’avère qu’une teneur en hydrogène de {\textasciitilde}150 ppm-masse n'a qu'un effet très faible sur
le comportement du M5 aussi bien en fluage qu’en rampe de température, cet effet restant proche
de la dispersion expérimentale intrinsèque au matériau. Par conséquent on montre que, compte
tenu de sa précision, le modèle EDGAR M5 V1 identifié sur matériau vierge simule tout à fait
correctement le comportement de l’alliage M5 pré-hydruré à {\textasciitilde}150 ppm-masse et peut donc être
conservé pour simuler le comportement du M5 pour les teneurs en hydrogène représentatives du
fonctionnement en REP.},

	abstract = {Aujourd’hui, la prospérité de nos sociétés repose sur une utilisation massive d’énergies. Pour répondre à ce besoin croissant et indispensable, il existe différentes ressources exploitables comme les énergies fossiles (pétrole, charbon, gaz…), les énergies renouvelables (solaire, éolien, hydraulique…) ou l’énergie nucléaire. Ces ressources possèdent chacune des forces et des faiblesses et sont au cœur d’enjeux environnementaux majeurs.
En France, l’énergie nucléaire occupe une place prédominante avec ses 58 réacteurs et assure près de 80 \% de la production d’électricité du pays. Un 59ème réacteur est en construction à Flamanville avec une capacité de puissance de 1600 MW, suffisante pour alimenter une ville comme Paris. 
Le CEA participe activement à l’évolution des technologies pour l’énergie et développe notamment de nouvelles générations de réacteurs nucléaires, améliorant les performances, la durabilité, la sûreté et l’économie de ces systèmes. C’est dans ce contexte qu’est né le projet de concevoir le réacteur rapide refroidi au sodium ASTRID. Dès à présent, les activités de R\&D menées par le CEA visent à réunir tous les éléments techniques qui permettront, dès 2012, de décider du cahier des charges du prototype.

Par conception, les réacteurs nucléaires se composent de différents types d’assemblages. Certains assemblages renferment le combustible nucléaire, d’autres assemblages, assurant la commande et l’arrêt du réacteur, contiennent des matériaux, dits neutrophages, qui absorbent les neutrons. Le travail présenté dans la suite de ce rapport concerne l’étude thermomécanique de dispositifs de commande et d’arrêt innovants, envisagés pour le réacteur ASTRID, en modifiant la structure géométrique et les matériaux neutrophages des assemblages actuels, dans le but d’améliorer leurs performances.

Dans un premier temps, nous donnons une rapide description du contexte et des éléments nécessaires à la compréhension du sujet. Puis nous présentons les études de dimensionnements analytiques, effectuées pour les dispositifs envisagés. Vient ensuite l’étude de différents matériaux neutrophages, après quoi nous décrivons l’utilisation que nous avons eue du code de calcul thermomécanique LICOS. Enfin, nous présentons les résultats et analysons l’intérêt de différentes configurations retenues.},

The single crystal comprises cylindrical voids with elliptical cross-section at arbitrary orientations and is subjected to general plane-strain loadings. The proposed model, called modified variational model (MVAR), is based on the nonlinear variational homogenization method, which makes use of a linear comparison porous single crystal material to estimate the response of the nonlinear porous single crystal. The MVAR model is validated by periodic finite element simulations for a large number of parameters including general in-plane crystal anisotropy, general in-plane void shapes and orientations, various creep exponents (i.e., nonlinearity) and general plane strain loading conditions. The MVAR model, which at the present state involves no calibration parameters, is found to be in good agreement with the finite element results for all cases considered in this work. The model is then used in a predictive manner to investigate the complex response of porous single crystals in several cases with strong coupling between the anisotropy of the crystal and the (morphological) anisotropy induced by the shape and orientation of the voids.},

	abstract = {Various models appropriate to the varying degrees of theoretical sophistication have been developed in fuel element structural analysis. Establishing these code systems required a tremendous amount of work relating to the mathematical/mechanical description to be done, and it seems that the standard of analytical modelling enables us to understand most of the intrinsic physical fuel rod phenomena.

Nevertheless, comparisons of theory and experiment or comparisons between several codes often show rather poor results. Moreover the interaction of complex material behavior and complex structural analysis makes it very difficult to identify the real sources of discrepancies. In most cases a few experiments with very specific objectives were used to calibrate the codes against experiments. But in general a limited data base can be understood quite satisfactorily even by contradictory models and, consequently, wide scattering results if models are applied to new situations.

In the present paper the basic structure of fuel element codes is discussed. The concept common to all fuel element structural analyses led to a general program structure which is presented in detail. The mechanical concepts of integral fuel element codes are reviewed, with special emphasis put on the modeling of pellet/cladding interaction and axial coupling. An attempt is made to classify material data and models, and the state of the art of accident analysis by means of fuel element codes is outlined.

The objective of this contribution is a completion of code ranking already carried out in the past. In contrary to code ranking where inevitably subjective criteria have to be used besides objective criteria, a classification of fuel element problems enables the community of fuel element structural analysts to take advantage of a much larger data base and to harmonize physical models or, perhaps, fuel element modeling in general.},

We describe the basic modelling hypotheses with particular attention being paid to the numerical treatment of non-linear stress relaxation phenomena such as cracking and creep of oxide fuels, cladding creep and plastic behaviour which are all accounted for. Calculation results are then shown to compare favourably over a wide range of experimental data points mainly pertaining to cladding diameter measurements of PWR rods. These results illustrate the validity of modelling hypotheses at different scales and are used to outline the areas of research that can be explored in an attempt to develop a more comprehensive and mechanistic approach to fuel rod modelling.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a complete formulation of a model of coupled associative thermoplasticity at finite strains, addresses in detail the numerical analysis aspects involved in its finite element implementation, and assesses the performance of the proposed mechanical and finite element models in a comprehensive set of numerical simulations. On the thermomechanical side, novel aspects of the proposed model of thermoplasticity are (1) the explicit characterization of the plastic (configurational) entropy as an independent internal variable, (2) a thermomechanical extension of the principle of maximum dissipation consistent with the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient, and (3) the exploitation of this extended principle in the formulation of an associative flow which characterizes the evolution of the plastic entropy in terms of the change of the flow criterion with respect to temperature. On the numerical analysis side, salient features of the proposed approach are (4) a new global product formula algorithm constructed via an operator split of the nonlinear initial value problem, which leads to a two-step solution procedure, (5) a unified class of local return mapping algorithms which preserves exactly the incompressibility constraint on the plastic flow and reduces to the classical radial return method for isothermal J2-flow theory, and (6) the formulation of a mixed finite element method in terms of the elastic entropy and the temperature field which circumvents well-known difficulties associated with the incompressibility constraint on the plastic flow. The exact linearization of both the product formula algorithm and an alternative simulataneous solution scheme for the coupled thermomechanical problem is given in two appendices.},

	abstract = {This paper is devoted to the micromechanical analysis of effective behavior of heterogeneous materials with pressure-dependent plastic constituents. The micromechanical model is based on an extension of the NTFA method proposed by Michel and Suquet (2003, 2004). The local plastic strain field is divided into a volumetric part and a deviatoric part. Each part is expressed as a linear combination of relevant non-uniform plastic strain fields, called “plastic modes”. The non-uniform microscopic strain fields are thus described by a finite number of reduced internal variables. And the local constitutive models are then reformulated in terms of such variables. The proposed model is applied to two typical heterogeneous materials: inclusion reinforced composite and porous material. Numerical results obtained by the NTFA are compared with the direct finite element solutions. In particular, the macroscopic yield stresses of porous materials are compared between the NTFA and some recently proposed analytical criteria. Finally, as an application example, the micromechanical model is used to simulate laboratory tests performed on porous sandstone.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this work is the formulation, numerical implementation and initial application of a non-local extension of existing Gurson-based modelling for isotropic ductile damage and attendant crack growth. It is being carried out under the premise that void coalescence results not only in accelerated damage development (e.g., Needleman and Tvergaard, 1984), but also in damage delocalisation (i.e., via interaction between neighbouring Gurson RVE's). To this end, we proceed by analogy with the approach of Needleman and Tvergaard (1984) who replaced the Gurson void volume fraction f with a (local) effective damage parameter f∗ in the Gurson yield condition to account for the effect of void coalescence on the material behaviour. In the current case, the role of f∗ is taken over and generalised by an effective continuum damage field ν. A field relation for ν is formulated here in the framework of continuum thermodynamics. In the simplest case, the resulting relation is formally analogous to the inhomogeneous temperature equation in which void nucleation and growth represent (local) sources for ν and in which void coalescence takes place in a process zone whose dimension is determined by a characteristic material lengthscale. Analogous to temperature, then, ν represents an additional continuum degree-of-freedom here, resulting in a coupled deformation-damage field model. In the last part of the work, the complete model for coupled damage-deformation is implemented numerically using the finite-element method on the basis of backward-Euler integration and consistent linearisation. Using this implementation, the behaviour of the current extended Gurson-based damage model is investigated for the case of simple tension of an inhomogeneous steel block. In particular, the corresponding simulation results document quantitatively the dependence of the delocalisation of the model damage process and minimisation of mesh-dependence on the characteristic dimension of the damage process zone.},

	abstract = {The article presents a new formulation of isotropic elastoplasticity at large strains in both the Lagrangian and the Eulerian geometric setting and addresses aspects of its numerical implementation. The key ingredients on the theoretical side are the introduction of a plastic metric for the description of the local history-dependent inelastic material response, the definition of a convex elastic domain in the space of the local stress-like variable conjugate to the plastic metric, denoted as the plastic force, and a fully equivalent Lagrangian and Eulerian representation of all constitutive functions in spectral form for general non-Cartesian coordinate charts in terms of dual co- and contra-variant eigenvector triads which are normalized with respect to the plastic metric. On the numerical side, we propose a stress update algorithm for general non-associative isotropic elasto(visco)plastic response with an arbitrary number of scalar internal variables. The algorithm is based on an exponential map integrator and is recast into a general return mapping scheme, methodically organized with tensorial pre- and postprocessing and a constitutive box in the eigenvalue space. Furthermore, we propose a new perturbation stabilization technique which dramatically enhances the convergence of the general return algorithm. The theoretical and numerical developments are applied to a constitutive model problem with large elastic and large plastic strains: the von Mises-/Tresca-type associative plastic flow in Ogden-type large-strain elastic materials.},

	title = {Modèle {EDGAR} {Zy}-4 {AFA}-2G hydruré à 600 ppm {H} : identification sur une base fluage et rampes et application aux essais premier pic},
	abstract = {Un premier modèle EDGAR avait été établi sur Zy-4 bas étain 600 ppm H à partir d’essais de fluage
dans le domaine alpha et dans le domaine biphasé puis appliqué à une première série d’essais de
rampes de température en 2006. Il ressortait de cette étude que le critère de rupture établi pour le fluage
n’était pas adéquat pour la simulation des rampes de température. Ce modèle ne comportait pas d’effet
premier pic identifié.
Depuis, la base de données d’essai de rampes sur Zy-4 600 ppm H a été largement complétée, et des
transitoires premiers pics ont été effectués.
Ces transitoires, ici présentés, ont montré, pour le matériau hydruré à 600 ppm H, un effet très faible
d’un premier pic de température sur le comportement ultérieur (de l’ordre de grandeur de la précision du
modèle sur la simulation des rampes). A la différence du Zy-4 AFA 2G vierge pour lequel l’existence
d’un effet 1er pic a bien été confirmée, il n’a donc pas été jugé utile d’identifier spécifiquement cet effet
pour le Zy-4 AFA-2G hydruré à 600 ppm H.
Le nouveau modèle mécanique (modèle « 2010 ») a été identifié en optimisant les coefficients obtenus
en 2001 (sur la base de fluage) sur la base des essais de rampes uniquement. Cette méthode a permis
d’obtenir un compromis entre une simulation des essais de rampes améliorée et une dégradation faible
de la qualité de la simulation des essais de fluage.
Le critère de rupture a été ré-identifié manuellement.
Le modèle métallurgique n’est pas modifié par rapport au modèle établi en 2001.
Il a été vérifié a posteriori que ce modèle simulait de façon satisfaisante les transitoires de type premier
pic.
Il en ressort donc :
- qu’un nouveau modèle mécanique a été identifié pour le Zy-4 600 ppm H,
- que l’effet premier pic est faible sur le matériau hydruré et ne nécessite pas d’être modélisé
           spécifiquement pour le matériau hydruré à 600 ppm H
- que cet effet premier pic est confirmé sur le matériau vierge, ce qui constitue une différence
    majeure entre les comportements des matériaux vierge et hydruré, et ce point devra être
      examiné avec attention dans la perspective d’un potentiel modèle mécanique EDGAR « toutes
           teneurs H » pour le Zy-4},

This work presents a new phase field model for rate-independent crack propagation in rubbery polymers at large strains and considers details of its numerical implementation. The approach accounts for micro-mechanically based features of both the elastic bulk response as well as the crack toughness of idealized polymer networks. The proposed diffusive crack modeling based on the introduction of a crack phase field overcomes difficulties associated with the computational realization of sharp crack discontinuities, in particular when it comes to complex crack topologies. The crack phase field governs a crack density function, which describes the macroscopic crack surface in the polymer per unit of the reference volume. It provides the basis for the constitutive modeling of a degrading free energy storage and a crack threshold function with a Griffith-type critical energy release rate, that governs the crack propagation in the polymer. Both the energy storage as well as the critical energy release due to fracture can be related to classical statistical network theories of polymers. The proposed framework of diffusive fracture in polymers is formulated in terms of a rate-type variational principle that determines the evolution of the coupled primary variable fields, i.e. the deformation field and the crack phase field. On the computational side, we outline a staggered solution procedure based on a one-pass operator split of the coupled equations, that successively updates in a typical time step the crack phase field and the displacement field. Such a solution algorithm is extremely robust, easy to implement and ideally suited for engineering problems. We finally demonstrate the performance of the phase field formulation of fracture at large strains by means of representative numerical examples.},

	abstract = {Le travail de thèse porte sur la fissuration des pastilles combustible UO2 des réacteurs à eau pressurisée, et ses conséquences sur le comporte ment mécanique du crayon combustible. La fissuration conduit : 
- d’une part, à une importante relaxation des contraintes dont dépendent la plupart des autres phénomènes mécaniques et physico-chimiques ; 
- d’autre part, à la fragmentation de la pastille. Sa prise en compte est nécessaire pour une description correcte du chargement mécanique de la gaine au cours de l’irradiation.

L’approche locale de la rupture a été adoptée pour décrire la fissuration de la pastille. Des considérations pratiques nous ont amenés à privilégier une description quasi-statique de la fissuration du combustible à l’aide de modèles d’endommagement local. Ces modèles décrivent l’apparition de fissures par une perte de rigidité locale du matériau. Une telle description présente des difficultés de mise en œuvre, telles que des dépendancesdes résultats au maillage éléments finis et des évolutions discontinues de l’équilibre de la structure lors de propagations instables. Ces points ont fait l’objet d’une attention particulière car ils conditionnent l’utilisation de tels modèles dans les études combustibles.

Le travail effectué s’inscrit en support des différents schémas de cal-
culs du code ALCYONE développé au DEC/SESC au sein de la plateforme PLEIADES. Pour chacun de ces schémas, qui se différencient par les hypothèses de modélisation géométrique du crayon, nous avons proposé une modélisation des effets de la fissuration de la pastille.

La modélisation dite 2D axisymétrique du crayon combustible est la
 plus novatrice et a été de ce fait particulièrement étudiée. Nous montrons qu’elle est à même de rendre compte, grâce à une description appropriée de la fissuration du combustible, des principaux changements géométriques du crayon combustible intervenant en situation de fonctionnement normal ou incidentel.},

The finite element method was incorporated into the mechanical calculation segment of the code to enable the proper analysis of stress–strain status in the fuel pellet and cladding, and mechanical interaction between the fuel pellet and cladding (PCMI). The code features mechanistic analyses of the irradiation behaviors of fuel pins by integrating a number of models to analyze major irradiation phenomena, thus expressing actual fuel pin irradiation behaviors as accurately as possible. The analysis capabilities of the code were validated by calculations of fuel pellet temperatures, fractional fission gas releases of fuel pins and fuel pin cladding diametral strain profiles. Mechanisms of fuel pin irradiation behaviors such as redistribution of Americium, PCMI and joint oxide gain (JOG) formation were interpreted from code analyses for the actual irradiation test fuel pins.},

	abstract = {The formability of advanced high strength steels (AHSS) depends on the temperature-sensitivity of strength and strain hardening at large strain (∼0.4-0.5), in addition to traditionally-measured attributes such as isothermal strain hardening and strain-rate sensitivity. As such additional dimensions are incorporated into a constitutive model, it becomes progressively more complex and challenging to fit uniquely without invoking unrealistic numbers of fitting attempts starting from myriad sets of trial parameters. For 8-parameter constitutive equations similar to the ones investigated here, the literature reports fitting with 28 (256) starting sets of trial parameters, requiring 256 nonlinear optimizations using special programming, thus making such procedures impractical for many applications. An efficient, effective method requiring only 3 optimizations was proposed, developed, and confirmed for a diverse range of AHSS: DP590, DP780, DP980, TRIP780, CP1180 and TWIP. These alloys represent a wide range of hardening mechanisms, tensile elongations (0.05 to 0.5) and tensile strengths (590 to 1180 MPa). All results were derived from standard tensile tests, yet the extrapolated stresses of the constitutive models fit with the new method were confirmed independently within approximately 1\% standard deviation by balanced-biaxial bulge experiments at strains up to 6 times larger than the tensile range used to generate the constitutive models. Such accuracy at large strains is crucial for predicting the “shear fracture” of AHSS in practice. The final constitutive equations and parameters obtained using the new method are presented for each alloy, including a new form for TWIP steel.},

To retrieve a well-posed problem, the material state is described through the gradients of damage in addition to the strain and the damage. Under some assumptions, it is shown that these gradient laws can be cast into a variational formulation. Its numerical treatment is reduced to the design of a mixed finite element so that algorithms such as Newton’s method and path-following techniques are still available. Possible convergence difficulties related to the reduction of the damage band width and the appearance of micro instabilities are removed thanks to the design of a new class of brittle laws. Finally, numerical applications show the convergence with mesh refinement, the compatibility with coarser approaches such as Griffith’s theory and cohesive crack models, the robustness in case of unstable multi-cracking, the applicability to full-scale 3D situations and the physical relevance compared to experimental data.},

	abstract = {Non-local formulations have been intensively applied for the past 20 years to control the strain localisation resulting from strain-softening constitutive laws. We propose a framework that encompasses most of these non-local approaches. It relies on an energetic interpretation of both equilibrium equations and constitutive relations for generalised standard materials. It allows a systematic exploration of the properties of these models. We focus here on three aspects: the existence of solutions when applied to strain-hardening laws, the effective localisation control when applied to strain-softening laws and the thermodynamic bases.

A quite extended analysis is led under some assumptions, the more restrictive being that all the internal variables are dealt with the same regularising operator. It appears that only few approaches bring effective regularisation. Unfortunately, they do not rely on thermodynamic bases so that the Clausius–Duhem inequality is not automatically fulfilled. An alternative consists in giving up the assumptions of the analysis. In that case, it seems that no general result can be stated. Moreover, an illustration in the context of brittle damage shows that slightly different formulations can result in strongly differentiated behaviour, even though some specific choices lead nevertheless to a suitable model.},

	abstract = {The immediate cause of the March 2011 accident at
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was the melting
of the reactor core. During this process, the zirconium of
the fuel cladding reacted with the water, producing a
large amount of hydrogen. This hydrogen, combined with
the volatile radioactive materials, leaked out of the
containment vessels and entered into the reactor
buildings, resulting in explosions. In the past, stainless
steel was utilized as cladding in many pressurized water
reactors (PWRs), and its performance under irradiation
was excellent. However, stainless steel was replaced by
zirconium-based alloy as cladding material mainly due to
its lower neutron absorption cross section. Now, stainless
steel cladding appears as a possible solution for safety
problems related to hydrogen production and explosion.
The aim of this paper is to discuss the steady-state
irradiation performance using stainless steel as cladding.
The results show that stainless steel rods display higher
fuel temperatures and wider pellet-cladding gaps than
Zircaloy rods and no gap closure. The thermal
performance of the two rods is very similar and the
neutron absorption penalty due to stainless steel use
could be compensating by combining small increase in U-
235 enrichment and pitch size changes},

Nous avons formé par thermodiffusion en laboratoire des blisters similaires à ceux observés sur des gaines de Zircaloy-4 irradiées en réacteur. Les caractérisations par métallographie, nanodureté, DRX et ERDA ont montré qu'un blister est constitué d'hydrures delta dont la concentration dans la matrice varie entre 80\% et 100\%, et que la matrice sous-jacente contient des hydrures radiaux. Nous avons modélisé la cinétique de croissance des blisters avec l'hystérésis de la limite de solubilité de l'hydrogène,puis défini le gradient thermique seuil permettant leur formation. Notre étude sur le comportement dilatométrique du zirconium hydruré montre le rôle important de la texture cristallographique du matériau, ce qui peut expliquer des différences de morphologie des blisters. En parallèle, des essais suivis par caméra infrarouge ont montré que des vitesses de déformation supérieures à 0,1/s induisent des échauffements locaux importants qui favorisent la localisation précoce de la déformation. Enfin, nous avons optimisé l'essai d'Expansion Due to Compression pour atteindre un niveau de biaxialité de déformation plane (essais HB-EDC et VHB-EDC), ce qui réduit fortement la déformation à rupture à 25°C et 350°C, mais seulement en l'absence de blisters. Un critère de rupture est proposé pour rendre compte de la baisse de ductilité des gaines en Zircaloy-4 non irradiées en présence de blisters.},

	abstract = {Macroscopic mode I ductile crack propagation in metallic sheets or plates often starts in mode I as a flat triangle (coplanar with the precrack) whose normal corresponds to the loading direction. After some limited extension, the crack becomes slanted and propagates under local mixed mode I/III. Modeling and understanding this phenomenon is challenging. In this work, the “computational cell” methodology proposed in [1], which uses a predefined crack path, is used to study flat to slant fracture transition. The energy dissipation rate is studied as a function of the assumed crack tilt angle. It is shown that a minimum is always reached for an angle equal to 45°. This correlates well with the variation of the crack tip opening angle (CTOA) or the mean plastic deformation along the crack path. Stress and strain states in the stable tearing region hardly depend on the assumed tilt angle. A parametric study shows that flat to slant fracture transition is less likely to occur in materials having high work hardening and favored if additional damage is caused by the local stress/strain state (plane strain, low Lode parameter) in the stable tearing region.},

	abstract = {The contribution presents a new micro-mechanically based network model for the description of the elastic response of rubbery polymers at large strains and considers details of its numerical implementation. The approach models a rubber-like material based on a micro-structure that can be symbolized by a micro-sphere where the surface represents a continuous distribution of chain orientations in space. Core of the model is a new two-dimensional constitutive setting of the micro-mechanical response of a single polymer chain in a constrained environment defined by two micro-kinematic variables: the stretch of the chain and the contraction of the cross section of a micro-tube that contains the chain. The second key feature is a new non-affine micro-to-macro transition that defines the three-dimensional overall response of the polymer network based on a characteristic homogenization procedure of micro-variables defined on the micro-sphere of space orientations. It determines a stretch fluctuation field on the micro-sphere by a principle of minimum averaged free energy and links the two micro-kinematic variables in a non-affine format to the line-stretch and the area-stretch of the macro-continuum. Hence, the new model describes two superimposed contributions resulting from free chain motions and their topological constraints in an attractive dual geometric structure on both the micro- and the macro-level. Averaging operations on the micro-sphere are directly evaluated by an efficient numerical integration scheme. The overall model contains five effective material parameters obtained from the single chain statistics and properties of the network with clearly identifiable relationships to characteristic phenomena observed in stress–strain experiments. The approach advances features of the affine full network and the eight chain models by a substantial improvement of their modeling capacity. The excellent predictive performance is illustrated by comparative studies with previously developed network models and by fitting of various available experimental data of homogeneous and non-homogeneous tests.},

Un certain nombre de matériaux auxquels l'ingénieur est confronté en pratique ne s'intègrent pas dans le cadre des matériaux standard généralisés (MSG) pour lesquels des algorithmes performants existent. Les lois de comportement des géomatériaux en sont une illustration typique. Cependant, ils ne sont pas les seuls. Par exemple, le comportement des métaux sous chargement cyclique est correctement décrit à l'aide de lois (visco-)plastiques non standard. Les bonnes propriétés des MSG découlent de la loi de normalité et de la convexité du pseudo-potentiel associé. Le concept de bi-potentiel, introduit par de Saxcé, généralise celui de pseudo-potentiel et permet d'écrire les lois d'évolution de certains matériaux non standard sous la forme de lois de normalité implicites. Ces matériaux appartiennent à la classe des matériaux standard implicites (MSI), dont la classe des MSG est un sous-ensemble. L'objet de la présente note est de montrer que le modèle de viscoplasticité cyclique à écrouissage cinématique non linéaire de Chaboche et al. fait partie de cette classe de matériaux.

Some materials interesting for engineering applications do not come with scope of generalized standard material (GSM) class for which efficient and robust algorithms are available. Typical examples are constitutive laws of geomaterials. Nevertheless, they are not the only ones. For instance, laws describing the behaviour of metals under cyclic loading which are accurately approached by non standard (visco-)plastic laws. The good properties of GSM result from the generalized normality rule and the convexity of the associated pseudo-potential. The concept of bi-potential, introduced by de Saxcé, extends the notion of pseudo-potential and enables to write the evolution laws as implicit normality rules. These materials belong to the implicit standard material (ISM) class, of which the GSM class is a subset. The aim of this paper is to show that the viscoplastic model with non-linear kinematic hardening proposed by Chaboche et al. belongs to this class of materials.},

The yield stress was found to increase with strain rate and to decrease with temperature. Macroscopic cracking of the samples was apparent after the tests at 1100 °C. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) image analyses revealed a pronounced grain boundary cracking in the core of the samples tested at 10 - 1 /s and at 1550–1700 °C. A hyperbolic sine model for the viscoplastic strain rate with a clear dependency on porosity was first developed. It was completed by a Drucker–Prager yield criterion with associated plastic flow to account for the porosity increase induced by grain boundary cracking. Finite Elements simulations of the compression tests on the dense UO2 were then successfully compared to the stress–strain curves, post-test diameter profiles and porosities at the pellets’ center, periphery and top extremity. The response of the grain boundary cracking model was then studied in biaxial compression, this condition being closer to that of the pellet during a RIA power transient.},

This paper proposes a general framework  for using concepts to control polymorphism in different ways. First, concepts  can be used to constrain parametric polymorphism, as exemplified by type  classes in Haskell. Second, concepts can be used to provide fine-grained control  of function and operator overloading. Finally, generic functions can be overloaded  (specialized) based on concepts, rather than simply on types. We describe  aC ++ implementation of a new mechanism, which we call enable if , and its role  in concept-controlled polymorphism.},

It can examine specifically multi-dimensional effects such as circumferential temperature variations due to non-uniform pellet—sheath gaps, longitudinal variations due to fuel pin end conditions, variations due to sheath appendages, etc. The code currently contains a transient thermal analysis, an elastoplastic analysis and a creep analysis. This paper focuses on the verification of the high temperature sheath creep analysis of the code. Comparisons between FAXMOD predictions using a specific creep law and out-reactor transient tube burst data demonstrate the code's capability to model high temperature creep behaviour within experimental accuracy. The treatment of sheath ballooning is discussed. The code's capability to represent both the fuel and sheath during an assumed fast transient is also demonstrated.},

An elastic-viscoplastic material model is used, with delocalization incorporated in terms of an integral condition on the rate of increase of the void volume fraction. Two model problems are analysed to study the effect of including this material length, one relates to localization of plastic flow in shear bands, while the other considers a metal matrix composite. Both model problems involve final failure in strongly nonhomogeneous strain fields, and it is shown that the inherent mesh sensitivity of the numerical failure predictions can be removed by using the nonlocal material model considered here.},

La première année de thèse a été consacrée aux points suivants :
(i) Choix des lois de comportement cristallines viscoplastiques pour les matériaux de structure CFC non-irradiés et irradiés.
(ii) Implémentation d'un modèle cristallin en grandes transformations pour les matériaux CFC à l'état non-irradié. Cette implémentation a été réalisée et testée dans le code de calcul ZéBuLoN du Centre des Matériaux. Deux méthodes d'intégration ont été utilisées et comparées : la méthode explicite de Runge-Kutta et la méthode implicite de Newton.
(iii) Identification des paramètres de la loi cristalline à l'état non irradié pour la nuance 304L, retenue pour cette étude.
(iv) Réalisation de calculs d'agrégats simplifiés avec la loi cristalline pour des niveaux moyens de déformation de l'ordre de 100\%.
(v) Réalisation de calculs de cellule poreuse avec la loi cristalline.

Par ailleurs, à partir des travaux de L. Vincent, une première modification a été réalisée dans le code de calcul CAST3M, afin d'adapter l'implémentation disponible à la loi de comportement cristalline adoptée dans nos travaux pour les matériaux CFC. Les résultats obtenus par les calculs numériques dans les deux codes (CAST3M et ZéBuLoN) présentent une bonne cohérence globale.},

	abstract = {A detailed knowledge of microstructural changes that occur in austenitic stainless steels during heat treatment and creep is of great interest, since the ductility and the strength of the material may change drastically after a long time. It is of practical importance to be able to predict when and in what amount different phases precipitate in the material. This study is part of a larger project aiming at constructing thermodynamic models for the development of the microstructure during isothermal heat treatment and creep. This work concerns the microstructural evolution during isothermal heat treatment of an austenitic stainless steel using atom probe field ion microscopy (APFIM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The investigated material was niobium-stabilised steel of type AISI 347 with the major chemical composition of 0.05C-18Cr-l lNi-0.8Nb-1.6Mn (wt\%). The steel was solution annealed at for 1100°C 3 min to obtain a homogeneous and well defined starting condition and test samples were heat treated at 500–700°C for up to 70000 h. The solution annealed material and the material isothermally aged at 500, 600 and 700°C have been studied using the APFIM for detailed chemical analysis of the matrix. The results have been compared with SEM and TEM investigations of Nb(C,N) precipitates and σ-phase in the material. Nb-N and Mo-B clustering (which probably affects the strength considerably) was found in material aged at 500°C.},

	abstract = {This study is concerned with the modelling of fuel behaviour and of pellet–cladding interaction (PCI). A new fuel software (PLEIADES) is currently co-developed by the Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) and Electricité de France (EDF). This software includes a multi-dimensional FE program (ALCYONE) devoted to Pressure Water Reactors (PWR) fuel rods. PCI studies are mainly undertaken with the 3D model of ALCYONE. The objectives of this work are twofold: first, to propose a constitutive model for the fuel pellet which accounts for the stress relaxation of the material resulting from cracking and creep, second, to estimate the impact of the pellet cracking on PCI.

In this paper, a mathematical formulation which couples a viscoplastic law for creep with a multi-surface plastic softening law for cracking is detailed, leading a two inelastic strains model. Mesh dependency is overcome thanks to a material parameter related to the finite element size. The 3D calculations of PCI presented in this paper show that the considered modelling of fuel cracking is consistent with the experimental knowledge available on crack development under irradiation. A parametric study is then presented which leads to the conclusion that the tangential stresses at the pellet cladding interface and hence the risk of PCI failure are significantly reduced when the fuel tensile strength is divided by two.},

The constitutive theory of isotropic thermoelasticity is first considered. The stress response and the entropy expression are derived in the case of quadratic dependence of the elastic strain energy on the finite elastic strain. Basic kinematic and kinetic aspects of the phenomenological and single crystal elastoplasticity within the framework of the multiplicative decomposition are presented. Attention is given to additive decompositions of the stress and strain rates into their elastic and plastic parts. The constitutive analysis of the stress-modulated growth of pseudo-elastic soft tissues is then presented. The elastic and growth parts of the deformation gradient and the rate of deformation tensor are defined and used to construct the corresponding rate-type biomechanic theory. The structure of the evolution equation for growth-induced stretch ratio is discussed. There are 112 references cited in this review article.},

This approach is valid for finite elastic and plastic strains, while rendering the choice and numerical integration of objective stress rates superfluous as the results are automatically objective. For small elastic strains our method reduces to the classical hypoelastic-corotational formulation provided that the Dienes objective stress rate is employed, while in the absence of inelastic deformation it coincides with the hyperelastic formulation. The validity of the model has been examined on four test problems and the numerical results were found to be in good agreement with either the exact solution or experimental data.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a modular formulation and computational implementation of a class of anisotropic plasticity models at finite strains based on incremental minimization principles. The modular kinematic setting consists of a constitutive model in the logarithmic strain space that is framed by a purely geometric pre- and postprocessing. On the theoretical side, the point of departure is an a priori six-dimensional approach to finite plasticity based on the notion of a plastic metric. In a first step, a geometric preprocessor defines a total and a plastic logarithmic strain measure obtained from the current and the plastic metrics, respectively. In a second step, these strains enter in an additive format a constitutive model of anisotropic plasticity that may have a structure identical to the geometrically linear theory. The model defines the stresses and consistent tangents work-conjugate to the logarithmic strain measure. In a third step these objects of the logarithmic space are then mapped back to nominal, Lagrangian or Eulerian objects by a geometric postprocessor. This geometric three-step-approach defines a broad class of anisotropic models of finite plasticity directly related to counterparts of the geometrically linear theory. It is specified to a model problem of anisotropic metal plasticity. On the computational side we develop an incremental variational formulation of the above outlined constitutive structure where a quasi-hyperelastic stress potential is obtained from a local constitutive minimization problem with respect to the internal variables. It is shown that this minimization problem is exclusively restricted to the logarithmic strain space in a structure identical to the small-strain theory. The minimization problem determines the internal state of the material for finite increments of time. We develop a discrete formulation in terms of just one scalar parameter for the amount of incremental flow. The existence of the incremental stress potential provides a natural basis for the definition of the geometric postprocessor based on function evaluations. Furthermore, the global initial-boundary-value-problem of the elastic–plastic solid appears in the incremental setting as an energy minimization problem. Numerical examples show that the results obtained are surprisingly close to those obtained by a reference framework of multiplicative plasticity.},

A new return mapping algorithm capable of accommodating general yield conditions, arbitrary flow and hardening rules and non-constant tangent elasticities is proposed.

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the analysis of failures in the moderator circuit branch piping of the ATUCHA-1 pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR), which is made of austenitic steel to DIN 1·4550 specification (similar to AISI 347). These failures are considered to result from thermal fatigue processes induced by fluctuations in a zone where stratified temperature layers occurred, the fluctuations being associated with variations in moderator flow.

The first section evaluates the possibility of cracking due to thermal fatigue phenomena and concludes that under service conditions a crack may initiate and grow through 7 mm thickness of the branch pipe. In laboratory thermal fatigue tests that simulated the thermomechanical conditions for such a component, the number of cycles required to initiate a thermal fatigue crack in a notched modified standard fatigue specimen was about 103. This value may be used to give a conservative prediction of the number of thermal cycles for crack initiation in actual branch pipes, including those subject to the cold plug condition which is produced in some emergency shut-down and valve testing situations.

It was also demonstrated that beyond a crack depth of 7 mm stress corrosion cracking is the main process in further crack propagation. The relevance of this prediction is confirmed by microfractographic observations, since the brittle nature of the fracture surfaces under service conditions appears very different from the transgranular ductile striations found in both thermal and mechanical fatigue test specimens as a result of interacting environmental effects.},

thermomécanique (sans pour autant modifier le modèle métallurgique) a-t-il été identifié sur la
base expérimentale des essais de rampe de température à 1, 5, 10 et 25°C/s. Cette nouvelle
identification permet de mieux simuler les essais en rampe de température et notamment de
mieux prédire le temps à rupture, sauf pour les rampes qui cassent à très haute température.

	abstract = {Two optimizations of the Expansion Due to Compression (EDC) test, which induces a near uniaxial loading, were proposed and developed to reach higher biaxiality ratios (ratio between mechanical quantities in axial and in circumferential direction). The first optimization, named HB-EDC for High-Biaxiality EDC, allowed to reach transverse plane strain conditions. The second optimization, named VHB-EDC for Very High Biaxiality EDC, was designed to reach higher loading biaxiality ratios. These optimized EDC tests were performed at 25 °C, 350 °C and 480 °C on unirradiated hydrided Cold Worked Stress Relieved (CWSR) Zircaloy-4 samples. First, samples unhydrided or uniformly hydrided up to 1130 wppm were tested. Second, samples hydrided at 310 wppm with a hydride blister were tested. A large ductility reduction is induced by the increase in biaxiality level in the absence of a hydride blister or with small blisters ( \&lt; 50 μ m deep). The fracture strain decreases quickly with the blister depth at 25 °C, but more progressively at higher temperature. An equation that quantifies the fracture strain reduction with the blister depth is proposed. Eventually, one of the tests developed in the present study, the HB-EDC test, was proven to be a good compromise between the test complexity and the stress state reached. It is a good candidate to characterize the mechanical behaviour of irradiated cladding.},

In a spatial setting, these equations may express a relationship between some objective rate of spatial stress tensor and the rate of deformation. Constitutive equations of this type characterize a variety of material models including hyperelasticity, hypoelasticity and elastoplasticity. Employing geometrical concepts, a family of unconditionally stable and incrementally objective algorithms is proposed for the integration of such rate constitutive equations. These algorithms, which are appropriate for finite deformation analysis, are applicable to any choice of stress rate and, in most cases, employ quantities that arise naturally in the context of finite element analysis. Examples illustrate the objectivity and accuracy of the algorithms.},

It extends and improves on the Transformation Field Analysis of Dvorak [2] by considering nonuniform transformation strains, also called plastic modes, and is referred to as the Nonuniform Transformation Field Analysis. The present study is devoted to the implementation of this new homogenized model into a structural computation.

A brief account on the reduction procedure is given first. Then the time-integration of the model which is required at each integration point of the structural problem is performed by means of an implicit scheme. Two examples are discussed. The response of the homogenized structure is compared to the “exact” response of the actual heterogeneous structure computed with a very fine mesh. It is seen that not only the structural response is accurately captured by the NTFA model, but also the local stress field is correctly approximated.},

The set of governing equations and jump conditions are derived for the energy minimizers admitting such surfaces of discontinuity from the variational principle. By constructing energy minimizing sequences having piecewise constant plastic and elastic deformation in two examples of ductile single crystals deforming in plane strain simple shear or uniaxial compression, it is shown that the formation of lamellae structure with grain boundaries is energetically preferable. The number of lamellae is estimated by minimizing the energy of grain boundaries plus the energy of boundary layers.},

The experimental results show that the stress–strain curves cannot be fitted with a unique power law as it is the case at smaller strain rates ( 10 - 9 – 10 - 5 /s). A strain-hardening also appears in most of the tests. The microstructural observations show a pronounced evolution of the porosity at the pellet center during the tests. A hyperbolic sine model which accounts for volume variations (pore compressibility) was therefore proposed to describe the behavior of UO2 on a large range of temperatures ( 1100 - 1700 ° C ) and strain rates ( 10 - 9 – 10 - 1 /s). The Finite Element simulations of the compression tests lead to results (maximum stress, axial and hoop strain distribution, porosity distribution) in good agreement with the measurements.

	abstract = {This work aims at the formulation of a gradient crystal plasticity model which incorporates some of the latest developments in continuum dislocation theory and is, at the same time, well-suited for a three-dimensional numerical implementation. Specifically, a classical continuum crystal plasticity framework is extended by taking into account continuous dislocation density and curvature field variables which evolve according to partial differential equations (Hochrainer et al., 2014; Ebrahimi et al., 2014). These account for dislocation transport and curvature-induced line-length production and have been derived from a higher-dimensional continuum dislocation theory. The dislocation density information is used to model work hardening as a consequence of dislocation entanglement.

A composite microstructure is simulated consisting of a soft elasto-plastic matrix and hard elastic inclusions. The particles are assumed to act as obstacles to dislocation motion, leading to pile-ups forming at the matrix–inclusion interface. This effect is modeled using gradient plasticity with a simplified equivalent plastic strain gradient approach (Wulfinghoff et al., 2013) which is used here in order to allow for an efficient numerical treatment of the three-dimensional numerical model. A regularized logarithmic energy is applied which is intended to approximate the higher order gradient stress of the statistical theory of Groma et al. (2003).},

	abstract = {. We present a unified approach for expressing high performance numerical linear algebra routines for large classes of dense and sparse matrices. As with the Standard Template Library [10], we explicitly separate algorithms from data structures through the use of generic programming techniques. We conclude that such an approach does not hinder high performance. On the contrary, writing portable high performance codes is actually enabled with such an approach because the performance critical code sections can be isolated from the algorithms and the data structures. We also tackle the performance portability problem for particular architecture dependent algorithms such as matrix-matrix multiply. Recently, code generation systems (PHiPAC [3] and ATLAS [15]) have been created to customize the algorithms according to architecture. A more elegant approach is to use template metaprograms [18] to allow for variation. In this paper we introduce the Basic Linear Algebra Instruction Set (BLAIS), ...},

Toughness is also degraded as the fracture mechanism evolves from microvoid coalescence in the unirradiated condition to highly localized deformation in a decohesion zone in the severely irradiation embrittled state. Current toughness models are inadequate and better understanding of the micromechanics and macromechanics of deformation and fracture is needed to reliably predict failure criteria for fusion structures. While irradiated welds appear to have the least favorable combination of strength and ductility, cold-worked steels appear to show less mechanical degradation than solution annealed alloys.},

	abstract = {The paper outlines a new constitutive model and experimental results of rate-dependent finite elastic–plastic behavior of amorphous glassy polymers. In contrast to existing kinematical approaches to finite viscoplasticity of glassy polymers, the formulation proposed is constructed in the logarithmic strain space and related to a six-dimensional plastic metric. Therefore, it a priori avoids difficulties concerning with the uniqueness of a plastic rotation. The constitutive framework consists of three major steps: (i) A geometric pre-processing defines a total and a plastic logarithmic strain measures determined from the current and plastic metrics, respectively. (ii) The constitutive model describes the stresses and the consistent moduli work-conjugate to the logarithmic strain measures in an analogous structure to the geometrically linear theory. (iii) A geometric post-processing maps the stresses and the algorithmic tangent moduli computed in the logarithmic strain space to their nominal, material or spatial counterparts in the finite deformation space. The analogy between the formulation of finite plasticity in the logarithmic strain space and the geometrically linear theory of plasticity makes this framework very attractive, in particular regarding the algorithmic implementation. The flow rule for viscoplastic strains in the logarithmic strain space is adopted from the celebrated double-kink theory. The post-yield kinematic hardening is modeled by different network models. Here, we compare the response of the eight chain model with the newly proposed non-affine micro-sphere model. Apart from the constitutive model, experimental results obtained from both the homogeneous compression and inhomogeneous tension tests on polycarbonate are presented. Besides the load–displacement data acquired from inhomogeneous experiments, quantitative three-dimensional optical measurements of the surface strain fields are carried out. With regard to these experimental data, the excellent predictive quality of the theory proposed is demonstrated by means of representative numerical simulations.},

	abstract = {Among the “theories” applied to model concrete behavior, damage mechanics has proven to be efficient. One of the first models for concrete introduced into such a framework is Mazars’ damage model. A new formulation of this model, called the “μ model” and based on a coupling of elasticity and damage within an isotropic formulation, is proposed herein for the purpose of 3D cyclic and dynamic loadings. Unilateral behavior (i.e., crack opening and closure) is introduced by use of two internal variables. A threshold surface is then associated with each of these variables. The shape of such surfaces has been chosen to model as accurately as possible concrete behavior under various loadings, i.e., tension, compression, shear, biaxial and triaxial, in the aim of simulating a large number of loading types (monotonic, cyclic, seismic, blast, impact, etc.). Applications of this model are presented on plain or reinforced concrete elements subjected to a range of loadings (e.g., multiaxial, cyclic, dynamic). A comparison with experimental results serves to demonstrate the effectiveness of these various selected options.},

Pellet samples were tested at four temperatures (1100, 1350, 1550 and 1700 ° C ) and at a strain rate varying over 4 decades ( 10 - 4 – 10 - 3 – 10 - 2 – 10 - 1 /s). The experimental results show that the stress–strain curves cannot be fitted with a unique power law as it is the case at smaller strain rates ( 10 - 9 – 10 - 5 /s). A strain-hardening also appears in most of the tests. The microstructural observations show a pronounced evolution of the porosity at the pellet center during the tests. A hyperbolic sine model which accounts for volume variations (pore compressibility) was therefore proposed to describe the behavior of UO2 on a large range of temperatures ( 1100 - 1700 ° C ) and strain rates ( 10 - 9 – 10 - 1 /s). The Finite Element simulations of the compression tests lead to results (maximum stress, axial and hoop strain distribution, porosity distribution) in good agreement with the measurements. The model was then assessed on a database of more than two hundred creep tests.},
