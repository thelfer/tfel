# Introduction

`MFront` version 3.0 provides two interfaces for the `Abaqus/Standard`
and `Abaqus/Explicit` finite element solvers. Those interfaces are
fairly features complete:

- Isotropic and orthotropic materials are supported.
- Small and finite strain behaviours are supported.

It shall be pointed out that the `Abaqus/Standard` and
`Abaqus/Explicit` solvers have a long history. In particular, the
design choices made for the `UMAT` and `VUMAT` interfaces were meant
to allow the users to easily write finite-strain behaviours in
rate-form. However, their choices differ in many points. As a
consequence, those interfaces are not compatible "out of the box":
i.e. one cannot restart a simulation with `Abaqus/Explicit` after a
computation with `Abaqus/Standard` without precautions.

`MFront` strives to provides behaviours that can be used "just-like"
other `UMAT` and `VUMAT` subroutines, but there are some cases (namely
finite strain orthotropic behaviours) where we were obliged to make
some unusual choices that are described in this document for various
reasons:

- Ensure the compatibility between the `Abaqus/Standard` and
  `Abaqus/Explicit`.
- Have optimal performances.

## Pitfalls

There are also cases of misuses of the generated libraries that can
*not* be prevented by `MFront`. The most important ones are the
following:

- For `Abaqus/Standard`, small strain isotropic behaviour can be used
  in finite strain analyses "out of the box". However, if a behaviour
  is meant to be used only for finite strain analyses, we recommend
  using **one of the finite strain strategies available** (See the
  `@AbaqusFiniteStrainStrategy` keyword and the section dedicated to
  finite strain strategies below). The `Native` finite strain strategy
  will use the `Abaqus/Standard` functionalities to integrate the
  behaviour in "rate-form" and also adds a correction to the
  tangent operator (see below for details). *The user must then be
  aware that when using the `Native` finite strain strategy, results
  will depend on the fact that an orientation is defined or
  not*.
  Futhermore, behaviours using the `Native` finite strain strategy (or
  no strategy at all) can not be ported to other solver. If
  portability is an issue, consider using one of the other finite
  strain strategy (see below).
- For `Abaqus/Standard`, the usage of the `Native` finite strain
  strategy is **not** compatible with `Abaqus/Explicit` because the
  latter always uses a corotationnal frame associated with the
  Green-Nagdy objective derivative to integrate the behaviour in
  rate-form, when `Abaqus/Standard` uses a corotationnal frame
  associated with the Jaumann objective derivative.
- For `Abaqus/Standard`, the number of field variables (corresponding
  to external state variables in `MFront`) can not be checked.
- For `Abaqus/Standard`, one shall *not* combine the `MFront`
  orthotropy policy with the definition of an orientation.
- For `Abaqus/Standard`, one have to use the `MFront` orthotropy
  policy to handle orthotropic finite strain behaviours (see below for
  details).

## Current status

These interfaces have been extensively tested through `MTest`. Tests
on `Abaqus/Standard` and `Abaqus/Explicit` shows that MFront
behaviours are efficient (to the extent allowed by the `UMAT` and
`VUMAT` interfaces respectively) and reliable.

# How the use `MFront` behaviours in `Abaqus/Standard` and `Abaqus/Explicit`

When compiling mechanical behaviours with the `Abaqus/Standard` and/or
`Abaqus/Explicit` interfaces, `MFront` generates:

- shared libraries containing one implementation of the considered
  behaviours per supported modelling hypotheses.
- examples of input files in the `abaqus` or
  `abaqus-explicit` directory, respectively
- a copy of a generic `umat.cpp` file for the `Abaqus/Standard` solver
- a copy of generic `vumat-sp.cpp` (for single precision computation)
  and `vumat-dp.cpp` (for double precision computations) files for the
  `Abaqus/Explicit` solver

The user must launch `Abaqus/Standard` or `Abaqus/Explicit` with one
of the previous generic files as an external user file. Those files
handle the loading of `MFront` shared libraries *using the material
name*: the name of the material shall thus define the function to be
called and the library in which this function is implemented.

The function name includes the modelling hypothesis, see below. An
identifier can *optionally* be added to reuse the same behaviour for
several material (with different material properties for instance). The
identifier is discarded in the `umat.cpp`, `vumat-sp.cpp` and
`vumat-dp.cpp` files.

Thus, the material name in `Abaqus/Standard` and `Abaqus/Explicit` is
expected to have the following form:
`LIBRARY_FUNCTION_HYPOTHESIS_IDENTIFIER`.

The first part is the name of library, without prefix (`lib`) or
suffix (`.dll` or `.so` depending on the system). *This convention
implies that the library name does not contain an underscore
character*.

For example, on `UNIX` systems, if one want to call the
`ELASTICITY_3D` behaviour in ` libABAQUSBEHAVIOUR.so` library, the
name of the material in the `Abaqus/Standard` input file has to be:
`ABAQUSBEHAVIOUR_ELASTICITY_3D`.

This leads to the following declaration of the material:

~~~~~~~{.python}
*Material, name=ABAQUSBEHAVIOUR_ELASTICITY_3D
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is important to note that the name of the behaviour is
automatically converted to upper-case by `Abaqus/Standard` or
`Abaqus/Explicit`. The name of the libraries generated by `MFront` are
thus upper-cased. *The user shall thus be aware that he/she must not
rename `MFront` generated libraries using lower-case letters*.

## Notes

- The `MFront` libraries are only generated *once*, only the generic
  files needs to be recompiled at each run. This is very handy since
  compiling the `MFront` libraries can be time-consuming. Those
  libraries can be shared between computations and/or between users
  when placed in a shared folders.
- The fact that `MFront` generates one implementation per modelling
  hypothesis allows the distinction between the plane strain
  hypothesis and the axisymmetrical hypothesis. This is mandatory to
  consistently handle orthotropy.
- The name of the library can be changed by renaming it after the
  compilation or by using the `@Library` keyword.

### Note on libraries locations

As explained above, `MFront` libraries will be loaded at the runtime
time. This means that the libraries must be found by the dynamic
loader of the operating system.

#### Under Linux

Under Linux, the search path for dynamic libraries are specified using
the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable environment. This variable defines a
colon-separated set of directories where libraries should be searched
for first, before the standard set of directories.

Depending on the configuration of the system, the current directory
can be considered by default.

#### Under Windows

Under Windows, the dynamic libraries are searched:

- in the current directory
- in the directories listed in the `PATH` environment. This
  variable defines a semicolon-separated set of directories.

## Compilation of the generic `umat.cpp` or `vumat-*.cpp` files

Depending on the compiler and compiler version, appropriate flags
shall be added for the compilation of the generic `umat.cpp` or
`vumat-*.cpp` files which are written against the `C++11` standard.

The procedure depends on the version of `Abaqus` used. In every case,
one shall modify a file called `abaqus_v6.env` which is delivered with
`Abaqus`. The modified version of this file must be in the current
working directory.

### Versions later than `Abaqus 2017`

In the `abaqus_v6.env`, one can load a specific environment file using
the `importEnv` function:

~~~~{.python}
# Import site specific parameters such as licensing and doc parameters
importEnv('<path>/custom_v6.env')
~~~~

This file, called `custom_v6.env`, is used to modify the `compile_cpp`
entry which contains the command line used to compile `C++` files. The
content of this file can be copied from one of the system specific
environment file delivered with `Abaqus`. For example, under `LinuX`,
one can use the `lnx86_64.env` as a basis to build the
`custom_v6.env`.

Here is an example of a modified `custom_v6.env` (we changed several
paths that must be updated to match your installation):

~~~~{.python}

usub_lib_dir='<path_to_mfront_generated_libraries>:<path_to_mfront>/lib'
~~~~

The last line define a set of paths where shared libraries will be
searched for, which is useful if one does not want to install `TFEL`
and `MFront` on in system-wide path (such as `/usr/`) or modify the
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. One can also specify a shared
directory (on a NFS file system for example) to access material
behaviours shared among a team of colleagues.

### Versions prior to `Abaqus v2017`

The appropriate flags can be defined in the `abaqus_v6.env` file that
can be overridden by the user.

For the `gcc` compiler, one have to add the `--std=c++11` flag. The
modifications to be made to the `abaqus_v6.env` are the following:

~~~~{.python}

compile_cpp = [cppCmd,
               '-c', '-fPIC', '-w', '-Wno-deprecated', '-DTYPENAME=typename',

# Main features

## Supported behaviours

Isotropic and orthotropic behaviours are both supported.

For orthotropic behaviours, there are two orthotropy management policy
(see the `AbaqusOrthotropyManagementPolicy` keyword):

- `Native`: an orientation *must* be defined
- `MFront`: **no** orientation *must* be defined. The material frame
  is defined through additional state variables.

For `Abaqus/Standard`, small and finite strain behaviours are
supported. **For orthotropic finite strain behaviours, one must use
the `MFront` orthotropy management policy**. The reason of these
choices is given below.

For `Abaqus/Explicit`, only finite strain are supported. Small strain
behaviours can be used using one of the finite strain strategies
available.

## Modelling hypotheses

The following modelling hypotheses are supported:

- tridimensional (`3D`)
- plane strain (`PSTRAIN`)
- plane stress (including shell elements) (`PSTRESS`)
- axisymmetrical (`AXIS`)

The generalised plane strain hypothesis is currently *not* supported.

# The `Abaqus/Standard` interface

The `Abaqus/Standard` solver provides the `UMAT` interface. In this
case, the behaviour shall compute:

- The evolution of the state variables.
- The value the Cauchy stress at the end of the time step.
- The consistent tangent operator. The definition of the consistent
  tangent operator is given below.

For finite strain analyses, small strain behaviours can be written in
rate form. The behaviour in integrated in the
Jauman framework. This is different from `Abaqus/Explicit` which
uses a corotational basis based on the Green-Nagdi rate.

## Finite strain behaviours and orthotropy management policy

Orthotropic finite strain behaviours are only supported using the
`MFront` orthotropy management policy. In this case, all quantities are
expressed in the global configuration. Rotation in the initial material
frame is handled by `MFront`.

## Finite strain strategies

Engineers are used to write behaviours based on an additive split of
strains, as usual in small strain behaviours. Different strategies
exist to:

- write finite strain behaviours that preserve this property.
- guarantee some desirable properties such as energetic consistency
  and objectivity.

Through the `@AbaqusFiniteStrainStrategy`, the user can select on of
various finite strain strategies supported by `MFront`, which are
described in this paragraph.

> **Note**
>
> The usage of the `@AbaqusFiniteStrainStrategy` keyword is mostly
> deprecated since `MFront 3.1`: see the `@StrainMeasure` keyword.

### The `Native` finite strain strategy

Among them is the `Native` finite strain strategy which relies on
build-in `Abaqus/Standard` facilities to integrate the behaviours
written in rate form. The `Native` finite strain strategy will use the
Jauman rate.

Those strategies have some theoretical drawbacks
(hypoelasticity, etc...) and are not portable from one code to
another.

### Recommended finite strain strategies

Two other finite strain strategies are available in `MFront` for the
`Abaqus/Standard` interface (see the `@AbaqusFiniteStrainStrategy`
keyword):

- 'FiniteRotationSmallStrain': this finite strain strategy is fully
  described in @doghri_mechanics_2000,@edf_loi_2013
- 'MieheApelLambrechtLogarithmicStrain': this finite strain strategy
  is fully described in @miehe_anisotropic_2002 and
  @edf_modeles_2013. This finite strain strategy is yet to be
  implemented.

Those two strategies use lagrangian tensors, which automatically
ensures the objectivity of the behaviour.

Each of these two strategies define an energetic conjugate pair of
strain or stress tensors:

- For the 'FiniteRotationSmallStrain' case, the strain tensor is the
  Green-Lagrange strain and the conjugated stress is the second
  Piola-Kirchhoff stress.
- For the 'MieheApelLambrechtLogarithmicStrain', the strain tensor is
  the langrangian Hencky strain tensor, i.e. the logarithm of the
  stretch tensor.

The first strategy is suited for reusing behaviours that were
identified under the small strain assumptions in a finite rotation
context. The usage of this behaviour is still limited to the small
strain assumptions.

The second strategy is particularly suited for metals, as
incompressible flows are characterized by a deviatoric logarithmic
strain tensor, which is the exact transposition of the property used
in small strain behaviours to handle plastic incompressibility. This
means that all valid constitutive equations for small strain
behaviours can be automatically reused in finite strain analysis. This
does *not* mean that a behaviour identified under the small strain
assumptions can be directly used in a finite strain analysis: the
identification would not be consistent.

Those two finite strain strategies are fairly portable and are
available (natively or via `MFront`) in `Cast3M`, `Code_Aster`,
`Europlexus` and `Zebulon`, etc...

## Consistent tangent operator for finite strain behaviours

The "Abaqus User Subroutines Reference Guide" indicates that the
tangent moduli required by `Abaqus/Standard` \(\CMJ\) is
closely related to \(\tenseurq{C}^{\tau\,J}\), the moduli associated
to the Jauman rate of the Kirchhoff stress :

\[
J\,\CMJ=\CtJ
\]

where \(J\) is the determinant of the deformation gradient
\(\tns{F}\).

By definition, \(\CtJ\) satisfies:
\[
\overset{\circ}{\tenseur{\tau}}^{J}=\CtJ\,\colon\tenseur{D}
\]
where \(\tenseur{D}\) is the rate of deformation.

# The `Abaqus/Explicit` interface

Using `Abaqus/Explicit`, computations can be performed using single
(the default) or double precision. The user thus must choose the
appropriate generic file for calling `MFront` behaviours:

- the `vumat-sp.cpp` file is used for single precision.
- the `vumat-dp.cpp` file is used for double precision.

*For double precision computation, the user must pass the
`double=both` command line arguments to `Abaqus/Explicit` so that both
the packaging steps and the resolution are performed in double
precision* (by default, if only the `double` command line argument is
passed to `Abaqus/Explicit`, the packaging step is performed in single
precision and the resolution is performed in double precision).

**It is important to carefully respect those instructions: otherwise,
`Abaqus/Explicit` will crash due to a memory corruption (segmentation
error)**.

Here is an example of `Abaqus` invocation: 

~~~~{.sh}
Abaqus user=vumat-dp.cpp double=both job=...
~~~~

## Finite strain strategies

As for `Abaqus/Standard`, user may choose one of the finite strain
strategies available through `MFront`.

### The `Native` finite strain strategy

The `Native` finite strain strategy relies on build-in
`Abaqus/Explicit` facilities to integrate the behaviours written in
rate form, i.e. it will integrate the behaviour using a corotationnal
approach based on the polar decomposition of the deformation gradient.

### Recommended finite strain strategies

The other finite strain strategies described for `Abaqus/Standard` are
also available for the `Abaqus/Explicit` interface:

- 'FiniteRotationSmallStrain'
- 'MieheApelLambrechtLogarithmicStrain'

## Energies

`MFront` behaviours can optionally compute the stored and dissipated
energies through the `@InternalEnergy` and `@DissipatedEnergy` keywords.

In `Abaqus/Standard`, the stored energy is returned in the `SSE` output
and the dissipated energy is returned in the `SPD` output.

In `Abaqus/Explicit`, the stored energy is returned in the
`enerInternNew` variable and the dissipated energy is returned in
the `enerInelasNew` output.

# Appendix

!["Relation between tangent operators"](img/FiniteStrainTangentOperatorConvertion.svg "Supported relations between tangent operators in `MFront`")

Most information reported here are extracted from the book of
Belytschko (@belytschko_nonlinear_2000).

## Relations between tangent operator

#### Relation with the moduli associated to the Truesdell rate of the Cauchy Stress $\CsT$

The moduli associated to the Truesdell rate of the Cauchy Stress
\(\CsT\) is related to \(\CtJ\) by the following relationship:

\[
\CtJ=J\,\left(\CsT+\tenseurq{C}^{\prime}\right)\quad\text{with}\quad\tenseurq{C}^{\prime}\colon\tenseur{D}=\tsigma\,.\,\tenseur{D}+\tenseur{D}\,.\,\tsigma
\]

Thus,

\[
\CMJ=\CsT+\tenseurq{C}^{\prime}
\]

#### Relation with the spatial moduli $\Cs$

The spatial moduli \(\Cs\) is associated to the Lie
derivative of the Kirchhoff stress \(\mathcal{L}\tenseur{\tau}\) ,
which is also called the convected rate or the Oldroyd rate:

\[
\mathcal{L}\tenseur{\tau}=\Cs\,\colon\,\tenseur{D}
\]

The spatial moduli is related to the moduli associated to Truesdell
rate of the Cauchy stress \(\CsT\):

\[
\CsT=J^{-1}\,\Cs
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
\CMJ = J^{-1}\Cs+\tenseurq{C}^{\prime} = J^{-1}\left(\Cs+\tenseurq{C}^{\prime\prime}\right)\quad\text{with}\quad\tenseurq{C}^{\prime\prime}\colon\tenseur{D}=\tenseur{\tau}\,.\,\tenseur{D}+\tenseur{D}\,.\,\tenseur{\tau}
\]

<!-- The relationship between \(CsJ\) and -->
<!-- \(\Cs\) can be expressed in component form as -->

<!-- \[ -->
<!-- CsJ_{ijlk}=\Cs+I_{ik}\tau_{jl}+I_{jl}\tau_{ik} -->
<!-- \] -->

<!-- where \tns{I} is the rank 2 identity tensor. -->

#### Relation with $\CSE$ 

The \(\CSE\) relates the rate of the second
Piola-Kirchhoff stress \(\tenseur{S}\) and the Green-Lagrange strain
rate \(\tenseur{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{GL}}\):

\[
\tenseur{\dot{S}}=\CSE\,\colon\,\tenseur{\dot{\varepsilon}}^{\mathrm{GL}}
\]

As the Lie derivative of the Kirchhoff stress
\(\mathcal{L}\tenseur{\tau}\) is the push-forward of the second
Piola-Kirchhoff stress rate \(\tenseur{\dot{S}}\) and the rate of
deformation \(\tenseur{D}\) is push-forward of the Green-Lagrange
strain rate \(\tenseur{\dot{\varepsilon}}^{\mathrm{GL}}\),
\(\Cs\) is the push-forward of
\(\CSE\):

\[
C^{c}_{ijkl}=F_{im}F_{jn}F_{kp}F_{lq}C^{\mathrm{SE}}_{mnpq}
\]

#### Link with $\deriv{\tsigma}{\tns{F}}$

For all variation of the deformation gradient \(\delta\,\tns{F}\), the
Jauman rate of the Kirchhoff stress satisfies:
\[
\CtJ\,\colon\delta\tenseur{D}=\delta\tenseur{\tau}-\delta\tns{W}.\tenseur{\tau}+\tenseur{\tau}.\delta\tns{W}
\]

with:

- \(\delta\tns{L}= \delta\tns{F}\,.\,\tns{F}^{-1}\)
- \(\delta\tns{W}= \Frac{1}{2}\left(\delta\tns{L}-\transpose{\delta\tns{L}}\right)\)
- \(\delta\tns{D}= \Frac{1}{2}\left(\delta\tns{L}+\transpose{\delta\tns{L}}\right)\)

Thus, the derivative of the Kirchhoff stress with respect to the
deformation gradient yields:
\[
\deriv{\tenseur{\tau}}{\tns{F}}=\CtJ\,.\,\deriv{\tenseur{D}}{\tns{F}}+\left(\tprd{\tau}-\tpld{\tau}\right)\,.\,\deriv{\tns{W}}{\tns{F}}
\]

with \(\delta\,\tenseur{D}=\deriv{\tenseur{D}}{\tns{F}}\,\colon\,\delta\,\tns{F}\) and \(\delta\,\tns{W}=\deriv{\tns{W}}{\tns{F}}\,\colon\,\delta\,\tns{F}\)

\[
\deriv{\tsigma}{\tns{F}}=\Frac{1}{J}\left(\deriv{\tenseur{\tau}}{\tns{F}}-\tsigma\,\otimes\,\deriv{J}{\tns{F}}\right)
\]

### Numerical approximation of \(\CMJ\)

Following @sun_numerical_2008, an numerical approximation of \(\CMJ\)
is given by:
\[
\CMJ_{ijkl}\approx\Frac{1}{J\,\varepsilon}\left(\tenseur{\tau}_{ij}\left(\tns{F}+\tns{\delta F}^{kl}\right)-\tenseur{\tau}_{ij}\left(\tns{F}\right)\right) \]

where the perturbation \(\tns{\delta F}^{kl}\) is given by:

\[
\tns{\delta F}^{kl}=\Frac{\varepsilon}{2}\left(\vec{e}_{k}\otimes\vec{e}_{l}+\vec{e}_{l}\otimes\vec{e}_{k}\right)\,.\,\tns{F}
\]

Such perturbation leads to the following rate of deformation:
\[
\delta\,\tenseur{D}=\left(\tns{\delta F}^{kl}\right)\,\tns{F}^{-1}=\Frac{\varepsilon}{2}\left(\vec{e}_{k}\otimes\vec{e}_{l}+\vec{e}_{l}\otimes\vec{e}_{k}\right)
\]

The spin rate \(\delta\,\tenseur{W}\) associated with
\(\tns{\delta F}^{kl}\) is null.

#### Relation with the moduli associated to the Truesdell rate of the Cauchy Stress $\CsT$

The moduli associated with Truesdell rate of the Cauchy Stress can be
related to the moduli associated to the Green-Nagdi stress rate.

\[
\CsG=\CsT+\tenseurq{C}^{\prime}-\tsigma\otimes\tenseur{I}+\Cspin
\]

where \(\Cspin\) is given in @simo_computational_1998. The computation
of the \(\Cspin\) moduli is awkward and is not currently supported by
`MFront`.
