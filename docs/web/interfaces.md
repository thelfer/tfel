 "Interfaces allow the creation of a source code which is specific to
 the targeted language or solver")

# Rationale

Material knowledge developed with `MFront` shall be independent of the
solver or language in which it will be used. On the other hand, one
shall also strive to make the use of the generated code as natural and
as efficient as possible.

To achieve these goals, we have introduced in `MFront` the concept of
interfaces.
