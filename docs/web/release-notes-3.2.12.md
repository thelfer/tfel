# Issues fixed

## Issue 705: [mfront] fix the computation of the derivative of some isotropic hardening rules

The corrected hardening rules did not take into account a theta factor
in the expression of the derivative of the elastic limit, which could
affect convergence when this parameter differs from `1`.

For more details, see <https://github.com/thelfer/tfel/issues/705>.
