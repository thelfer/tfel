# User defined behaviour in `CalculiX`

User-defined mechanical behavior can be implemented using three
different interfaces:

- The  native `CalculiX` interface.
- The `ABAQUS` `umat` routines for linear materials (small strain
  analyses).
- The `ABAQUSNL` `umat` routines for non linear materials (finite
  strain analyses).

There are two ways of introducing user-defined mechanical behavior:

- Modify the `CalculiX` sources. This option is supported for the
  three interfaces.
- Call a behavior defined in shared libraries.

Each of these approaches has its own advantages and its own
pitfalls.

The first one is intrusive and requires a partial recompilation of
`CalculiX`, which means having access to the sources and the rights to
install the executable if it is meant to be deployed on a system-wide
location.

The second one does not require any modification to `CalculiX`, is
generally easier to set up and is very flexible. There is no intrinsic
limitations on the number of shared libraries and functions that can
be dynamically loaded. It is thus quite feasible to create mechanical
behaviours databases by creating a shared library by specific
material. Such libraries will only be loaded if needed. In such an
approach, the mechanical behaviour is dedicated to a specific material
and is self-contained: it has no external parameter.

Shared libraries can be shared between co-workers by moving them on a
shared folder.

However, experience shows that using shared libraries can be confusing
for some user as they have to update their environment variables
(`PATH` on Windows or `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on Unixes) for the libraries
to be usable. Shared libraries can also be more sensible to system
updates.

## Using the `CalculiX` native interface

When compiling a `MFront` behaviour, the `CalculiX` native interface
is invoked as follows:

~~~~{.bash}
$ mfront --obuild --interface=calculix Chaboche.mfront
Treating target : all
The following library has been built :
- libCALCULIXBEHAVIOUR.so :  CHABOCHE
~~~~

The `libCALCULIXBEHAVIOUR.so` is generated in the `src`
subdirectory. This library shall be copied in a location where the
dynamic loade can find it. Another solution is to add the `src`
directory to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` as follows:

~~~~{.bash}
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd)/src:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
~~~~

An template for the behaviour declaration has been generated in the
`calculix` subdirectory.

~~~~

The interesting part here is the name of the material:
`CALCULIXBEHAVIOUR_CHABOCHE`, which can be decomposed in two parts
separated by the underscore character (`_`):

- The first part, `CALCULIXBEHAVIOUR`, is used to determine in which
  library the external function is implemented.
- The second part, `CHABOCHE`, gives the name of external function to
  be called.

Here, the library name has been stripped from system-specific
convention (the leading `lib` and the `.so` extension). **The base
name of the library and the name of the function must be
upper-cased**. This is due to the way `CalculiX` interprets the input
file.

The material name can optionally ends with an identifier beginning by
the `@` character. This character can be followed by any character and
is used to declare two distinct materials based on the same external
behaviour having different material coefficients. For example, the
following example declares two distinct materials relying on the same
external behaviour:

~~~~{.fortran}
*Material, name=@CALCULIXBEHAVIOUR_ELASTICITY@1
** The material properties are given as if we used parameters to explicitly
** display their names. Users shall replace those declaration by
** theirs values
*User Material, constants=2

*Material, name=@CALCULIXBEHAVIOUR_ELASTICITY@2
*User Material, constants=2
200000,0.3
~~~~

### Using a small strain behaviour in finite strain analysis

In finite strain, `CalculiX` replaces the linearised strain by the
Green-Lagrange strain and interprets the output of the behaviour as
the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress. This allows small strain behaviours
to be used in the context of finite rotations and this procedures is
equivalent to the `FiniteRotationSmallStrain` introduced by `MFront`
in most interfaces. However, this procedure is said to be limited to
small strain because the trace of the Green-Lagrange strain is not
related to the change of volume, which is basis of most behaviours
describing plasticity and viscoplasticity in small strain: indeed,
even though the plastic strain is traceless, the plastic flow will not
be *isochoric*.

The situation is quite different in the `ABAQUSNL` interface where the
Hencky strain (logarithmic strain) is used (see below): the trace of
the logarithimc strain is directly linked to the change of volume.

This situation is also different from the strategy used in
`Abaqus/Standard` which tries to integrate the behaviour in rate form
and then uses the Jauman objective stress rate to ensure objectivity
(see [@hughes_finite_1980]): this approach is based of the fact that
the trace of the deformation rate is directly linked to the change of
volume.

To describe plasticity and viscoplasticity at finite strain using an
additive decomposition of the strain, we recommend using the
'MieheApelLambrechtLogarithmicStrain' finite strain strategy in
`MFront` which is also based on the Hencky strain but interprets the
output of the behaviour as the dual of the Hencky strain, which is
consistent from the point of view of energy and automatically ensures
objectivity. See [@miehe_anisotropic_2002] for details.

## Using the `Abaqus/Standard` interface

For performance reasons, `CalculiX` supports two kinds of interfaces
to `Abaqus/Standard`'s `umat` behaviours:

- `ABAQUS` is meant to describe linear materials.
- `ABAQUSNL` is meant to describe no linear materials. For nonlinear
  materials the logarithmic strain and infinitesimal rotation are
  calculated, which slows down the calculation. Consequently, the
  nonlinear routine should only be used if necessary.

Those two interface supports the call to behaviours in external shared
libraries.

Calling shared libraries is triggered by putting the `@` character in
front material name. The material name is then decomposed into three
parts, separated by the `_` character:

- The name of the interface (`ABAQUS` or `ABAQUSNL`).
- The base name of the shared library (see below).
- The name of the function implementing the behavior.

For instance, if we want to call a small strain behavior in a linear
analysis, implemented by the `CHABOCHE` function in the
`libABAQUSBEHAVIOURS.so` shared library (Under `Windows`, the library
name has the `dll` extension.), one would declare the following
material name:

`@ABAQUS_ABAQUSBEHAVIOURS_CHABOCHE`

## Using the `MFront` behaviours generated through the `abaqus` interface

As described in the previous section, calling shared libraries in only
supported for the `ABAQUS` or `ABAQUSNL` interfaces. This means that
we can call mechanical behaviours generated by `MFront` through the
`abaqus` interface quite easily.

The `abaqus` interface is described [here](abaqus.html).

### A first example, the Saint-Venant Kirchoff hyperelastic behaviour

#### Generation of the shared library

Consider the Saint-Venant Kirchoff hyperelastic behaviour as
implemented
[here](gallery/hyperelasticity/SaintVenantKirchhoffElasticity.mfront).

The library is generated like this:

~~~~~{.bash}
$ mfront --obuild --interface=abaqus SaintVenantKirchhoffElasticity.mfront 
Treating target : all
The following library has been built :
- libABAQUSBEHAVIOUR.so :  SAINTVENANTKIRCHHOFFELASTICITY_AXIS SAINTVENANTKIRCHHOFFELASTICITY_PSTRAIN SAINTVENANTKIRCHHOFFELASTICITY_3D
~~~~~

This shows that the library `libABAQUSBEHAVIOUR.so` has been
generated. Then, we have one implementation per modelling
hypothesis. For a \(3D\) computation, one shall use the
`SAINTVENANTKIRCHHOFFELASTICITY_3D` function.

Thus, the material name to be used is:
`@ABAQUSNL_ABAQUSBEHAVIOUR_SAINTVENANTKIRCHHOFFELASTICITY_3D`.

# Known issues

## Behaviours at finite strain with `CalculiX` 2.12

The source code generated by MFront contains a test that checks if the
behaviour is called in a finite strain resolution. This information is
not available in `CalculiX` 2.12. See the
`SaintVenantKirchhoffElasticity` example for details of how to
circumvent this issue.
