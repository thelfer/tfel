# Known incompatibilities

When compiling with option `TFEL_APPEND_VERSION` set to `ON` or when
defining the string variable `TFEL_VERSION_FLAVOUR`, the `python`
modules are now modified to reflect those information. This old
behaviour can be restored by setting the
`unversioned-python-module-names` option to `ON`.

# New features in the `TFEL` libraries

## Environment

This version now supports a new environment variable to specify the
`TFEL` installation directory that always supersedes the `TFELHOME`
environment variable. The name of this variable depends on the version
of the project, the fact that a development version has been compiled
and the flavour (optionally specified with the `cmake` variable
`TFEL_VERSION_FLAVOUR`). The name of this variable can be retrieved with
the `--tfel-home` option of `tfel-config` described below.

## `tfel-config`

### `--registry-key` option

On `Windows`, the `--registry-key` option returns the registry key which
is used to determine the TFEL's installation path.

### `--tfel-home` option

The `--tfel-home` option returns the environment variable in which the
TFEL's installation path shall be defined. 

#### Example of usage

~~~~
$ tfel-config-5.2.0-dev-release --tfel-home
TFELHOME_5_2_0_dev_release
~~~~

### `--python-module-suffix` option

This option return the suffix of the `python` module. Such suffix is not
empty only the following conditions are met:

- `TFEL` has been compiled with option `TFEL_APPEND_VERSION` set to `ON` and or
  with the string variable `TFEL_VERSION_FLAVOUR` defined,
- the `unversioned-python-module-names` option has been set to `ON` (the
  default value if `OFF`).

The option `--python-module-suffix` is only available if the python
bindings is available.

#### Example of usage

~~~~
$ tfel-config-5.1.0-release --python-module-suffix
5_1_0_release
~~~~

# Python bindings

Python bindings are now generated using the
[`pybind11`](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) library.
