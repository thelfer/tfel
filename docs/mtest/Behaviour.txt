The @Behaviour keyword declares the behaviour used for the test. This
keyword must be followed by an option specifying the interface used by
the behaviour. The umat, cyrano and aster interfaces are supported.

Two strings are then expected:
- the library in which the behaviour is implemented;
- the name of the function.

Example:
@Behaviour<umat> 'libMFrontCastemBehaviours.so' 'umatnorton';
